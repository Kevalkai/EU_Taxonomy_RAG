                "Generated Answer": "Based on the provided context, it is not sufficient that the vessel is certified for fuels from renewable sources (such as biofuels). According to Section 6.10. of Annex I, a vessel must meet the substantial contribution criteria, which includes running on zero direct CO2 emission or renewable fuels that comply with specific criteria (e.g., hydrogen and biogas/bioliquids) in order to be Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nWhile being certified for fuels from renewable sources may indicate that the vessel is using environmentally friendly options, it does not guarantee compliance with the zero direct CO2 emission requirement. The attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) value must also meet specific requirements, and the vessel's energy conversion system installed on board must be capable of running on these specified fuels.\n\nTherefore, a vessel cannot simply be certified for biofuels or other renewable fuels to be considered Taxonomy-aligned; it must demonstrate compliance with the zero direct CO2 emission criterion by meeting the EEDI requirements and using energy conversion systems that can run on compliant fuels.",

                "Generated Answer": "Based on the provided context, yes, the wording 'is based on a detailed building survey, an energy audit conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method' does mean that alternative methods are acceptable as long as they are 'transparent and proportionate'.\n\nThe fact that it mentions specific methods (detailed building survey, energy audit) suggests that these are the preferred methods for determining PED values. However, the phrase \"or any other transparent and proportionate method\" implies that other methods can also be used, as long as they meet the criteria of being transparent and proportionate.\n\nDetermining upper and lower estimated PED-values for existing energy labels and using the upper PED-values as the starting-PED-value to determine the starting point of a renovation would be acceptable. This is because these values are likely based on property characteristics and year of construction, which can be considered transparent and proportionate methods.",

According to the Commission Notice on the Climate Delegated Act, in the absence of a relevant EPC, a technical study can be done to estimate the relevant threshold for the top 15% of the national (or regional) building stock.\n\nHowever, the use of the year of construction of a building as a proxy is not allowed, as stated in response to question 151.

Implementation requirement: The substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation (included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act) require the implementation of identified adaptation solutions, whereas the DNSH criteria for climate change mitigation (included in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act) do not have this requirement.\n2. Scope of assessment: While both sets of criteria require a risk and vulnerability assessment, the substantial contribution criteria for adaptation cover a broader scope, including the identification of physical climate risks material to the activity, whereas the DNSH criteria for mitigation focus more on reducing risks associated with specific activities (e.g., extraction, storage, transport, or manufacture of fossil fuels).\n3. Eligibility reporting requirements: The reporting entity needs to demonstrate that a climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been performed and an expenditure plan has been set up for adaptation solutions in Annex II, whereas only the turnover derived from products or services associated with an adapted activity can be recognized for Taxonomy eligibility in Annex I.\n\nIn summary, while both sets of criteria share some similarities, such as the need for a risk and vulnerability assessment, the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation have a higher level of ambition than those for DNSH to mitigation, requiring implementation of identified adaptation solutions and more comprehensive assessment of physical climate risks.",

Specific disclosure obligations related to new nuclear energy and fossil gas-related economic activities:\n   The CDA amends the Climate Delegated Act by adding specific new nuclear energy and fossil gas-related economic activities to the EU Taxonomy.\n   It also provides specific disclosure obligations related to those activities in new Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n2. Mandatory reporting obligation for undertakings that are subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive:\n   The Delegated Act updates Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation to include undertakings that are subject to the obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU.\n\n3. Extension of reporting obligations to smaller undertakings:\n   The Delegated Act allows for voluntary reporting by undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD, in addition to those undertakings directly in the scope of the NFRD.\n\nThe amendments aim to increase transparency and disclosure around environmentally sustainable activities among larger undertakings, while also providing an option for smaller undertakings to report their alignment with the Taxonomy voluntarily.",

The statutory auditor or audit firm should express an opinion based on a limited assurance engagement regarding the compliance of the sustainability reporting with the requirements of Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n2. For some activities, compliance with TSC (Taxonomy Standardized Classification) should be verified by an independent third party due to their complexity.\n\nAdditionally, the Taxonomy Regulation's provisions related to Taxonomy-eligibility reporting as part of the Disclosures Delegated Act are subject to a different verification process:\n\n1. Non-financial statements are subject to an existence check by the statutory auditor in accordance with the Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU.\n2. There is no requirement in Union Law to verify the content of the disclosures.\n\nHowever, the CSRD is expected to require auditors to verify and express an opinion on sustainability reporting's compliance with the requirements (including reporting according to the Taxonomy Regulation and its delegated acts).",
