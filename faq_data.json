    "question": "Will the technical screening criteria set out in the Climate Delegated Act be made stricter and updated over time?",
    "answer": "Article 19(5) of the Taxonomy Regulation requires the\nCommission\nto regularly review the TSC defining substantial contribution to environmental objectives and DNSH to those objectives. In case of activities identified as transitional in the Climate Delegated Act, the review would be conducted at least every three years to ensure the criteria remain on a credible transition pathway consistent with a climate-neutral economy. No minimum period is specified for the other activities. The TSC will be updated over time to keep them aligned with overall policy objectives, technological developments and the availability of scientifically robust evidence justifying the introduction of new or updated criteria.\nIn accordance with Article 20(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the Platform on Sustainable Finance shall advise the Commission on the development of additional TSC, including for additional activities, and updating of existing TSC.\nBased on this advice, the EU’s trajectory relative to its sustainability targets as well as on other feedback, the Commission may review the TSC and, where appropriate, amend the delegated acts establishing these criteria. As a result, the TSC could become stricter over time."

  {
    "question": "How will the Taxonomy be further developed – will there be more activities contributing to climate change mitigation (CCM) included in the Climate Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "Yes, the Taxonomy will continue to be developed over time. As far as climate change mitigation (CCM) is concerned, the Climate Delegated Act prioritised economic sectors and activities with the highest potential to make a substantial contribution to GHG emission reduction based on their share of overall emissions and their potential to reduce emissions. The scope defined for CCM has been replicated for climate change adaptation\n(48)\nSee Annex 6 of the impact assessment accompanying the first Climate Delegated Act for details available at: https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/taxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800-impact-assessment_en.pdf\n.\nHowever, not all activities potentially contributing substantially to climate objectives were included in the first Climate Delegated Act. A Complementary Climate Delegated Act amending the Climate Delegated Act was adopted to cover as transitional activities certain economic activities involving specific gas and nuclear-related technologies that were not part of the Climate Delegated Act.\nIn addition, further activities contributing to the climate objectives may be included in the Climate Delegated Act at the time of its future review or of the adoption of any future delegated acts containing activities contributing to the other four non-climate environmental objectives."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does checking the compliance with the TSC on the substantial contribution and the DNSH mean in practice?",
    "answer": "The checking of compliance with the TSC requires the collection and assessment of relevant information in order to determine if the economic activity fulfils the conditions set out in the TSC. All criteria related to substantial contribution and DNSH, as well as the minimum social safeguards referred to in Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation have to be met for an activity to be considered Taxonomy-aligned. For further guidance, users may consult the Taxonomy user guide on the Commission’s website\n(49)\n[add link when available]\n."

  {
    "question": "How should verification requirements in the technical screening criteria be understood? What documentary evidence could support the demonstration and verification of compliance with those criteria?",
    "answer": "The Climate Delegated Act contains specific verification requirements for certain activities, in line with point (k) of Article 19(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, which requires that the TSC are easy to use and be set in a manner that facilitates the verification of their compliance. This is the case where the criteria rely on elements that require specialist knowledge. The accuracy of such information would be difficult to check for investors. Therefore, the TSC for specific activities include external verification requirements for activities where such concerns are present. Where the Climate Delegated Act requires verification for certain activities, the report by the external verifier would constitute the evidence of compliance with those criteria. External verifiers can be either the relevant national competent authorities or an independent third-party verifier having no conflict of interest with the operator of the activity nor be involved in the development or operation of the activity.\nFor example, the forest management plans in Sections 1.1.-1.4. on the forestry activities are highly context specific, and therefore external verification of these plans and their implementation is necessary to give sufficient certainty to investors. For several energy and some manufacturing activities, such as ‘Manufacture of other low carbon technologies’ in Sections 3.6., ‘Manufacture of plastics in primary form’ in Section 3.17., ‘Electricity generation from geothermal energy’ in Section 4.6., specific thresholds for GHG emissions are central to the TSC, and their external verification can serve to inform investors of compliance with TSC.\nWhere required, details of the verification of the criteria should form part of the disclosure of Taxonomy-alignment. Taxonomy-verification requirements are set to evolve together with other sustainability-reporting under the CSRD, once it enters into application."

  {
    "question": "Can technical consultancy services be counted as Taxonomy-eligible, and potentially Taxonomy-aligned, if they are related to an activity defined in the Taxonomy Delegated Acts?",
    "answer": "Only activities that are themselves set out in the Climate Delegated Act can be Taxonomy-eligible.\nThus, only the consultancy services that are explicitly covered by the Taxonomy, in particular with regard to climate change mitigation, in\n‘Professional services related to energy performance of buildings’\nin Section 9.3. and, with regard to climate change adaptation, in ‘\nComputer programming, consultancy and related activities’\nin Section 8.1. and ‘\nEngineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change’\nin Section 9.1.\nIn order to determine whether an activity is Taxonomy-eligible, the description of the activity must be used. The references to NACE codes with which such an activity could be associated are used for orientation purposes.\nConsultancy services related to other Taxonomy-eligible activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act are not eligible."

  {
    "question": "How should GHG emissions for technical screening criteria be calculated (scope, methodologies etc.)?",
    "answer": "There is no universal calculation method for GHG emissions in the Climate Delegated Act. Specific calculation methods are set out in the TSC for specific activities, in line with the methodological approaches based on the requirements laid out in Article 19 of the Taxonomy Regulation. See also on this point responses to activity specific questions, such as for instance Question 52."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can an undertaking's activities that are carried out in jurisdictions outside the EU be assessed for compliance with the technical screening criteria by reference to local third-country requirements or guidelines? When criteria refer to EU/national legislation or standards, should the level of requirements be adapted for criteria to be achieved outside the EU?",
    "answer": "As set out in the answer to question 18 of the first Commission Notice, disclosure obligations under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation apply to entities subject to the scope of the NFRD and to all their activities regardless of their location. While several of the TSC set out objective thresholds and requirements which do not refer to any location-specific regulatory requirements, some TSC refer to jurisdiction-specific requirements laid out in EU legislation. In general, for assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of an economic activity conducted outside the EU, undertakings should ascertain whether it is performed in compliance with the requirement applicable in Union legislation or, where mentioned in the TSC, a relevant international standard or equivalent applicable national law in a third country (for instance, references to such standards in the generic DNSH criteria for biodiversity protection set out in\nAppendix D\nof Annex I)."

  {
    "question": "How to interpret the use of “and” and “or” in the description of economic activities (for instance in ‘Construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from hydropower’ in Section 4.5; or ‘Construction and operation of electricity generation installations that produce electricity exclusively from biomass, biogas or bioliquids’ in Section 4.8)?",
    "answer": "The terms ‘and’ and ‘or’ are used interchangeably in the activity descriptions but not in the criteria where ‘and’ refers to a cumulative requirement. In general, an economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible if it constitutes any of the steps referenced in the description of the activity in bringing that activity to market (e.g. construction, operation, refurbishment, installation, maintenance etc.)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How to deal with technical screening criteria that are not relevant to a specific activity mentioned in the description (e.g. a maintenance-only service with no construction-related waste)?",
    "answer": "If the economic activity manifestly does not involve an element addressed by the TSC, an explanation of this fact can be provided in the disclosure of why the activity qualifies as Taxonomy-aligned without fulfillment of a specific criterion (e.g. the provision of a service included in the description which has no impact on other environmental objectives and thereby does not give rise to any potential issues with a DNSH-criterion)."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a number of cases of enabling activities, benchmarks compared to industry averages, peers or best available technologies are required. However, such information is not always available publicly. How should the requirement to provide these benchmarks be met?",
    "answer": "The TSC are not always exhaustive in how activities can qualify but in specific cases leave scope for case-by-case assessments by economic operators. Where the information required to demonstrate compliance relative to a metric or industry best practice depends on multiple factors or cannot be expressed in a straightforward way, operators should provide appropriate explanations, including any relevant independent third-party opinions, in their disclosures of why the activity is considered to qualify as Taxonomy-aligned."

  {
    "question": "How does the sustainable finance framework apply to access to private funding for the defence industry?",
    "answer": "The Commission acknowledges the need to ensure access to finance and investment including from the private sector for all strategic sectors, in particular the defence industry which contributes to European citizens' security.\nIn its communication of 15 February 2022 on European defence (COM(2022) 60) the Commission highlighted the need for initiatives on sustainable finance to remain consistent with the European Union efforts to facilitate the European defence industry’s sufficient access to finance and investment. The EU Sustainable Finance Framework focuses on ensuring transparency and does not impose any limitations to the financing any specific sector, including the defence sector.\nLike in any sector, undertakings involved in defence-related activities can claim Taxonomy-alignment for eligible horizontal investments stipulated in the Climate Delegated Act. This includes, for example, investments in greening their buildings, or investment in clean transport in the form of CapEx and/or OpEx referred to in point (c) of Sections 1.1.2.2. and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I to Disclosures Delegated Act. They can also claim alignment for any other activities identified in the Climate Delegated Act (for example activities in the field of transport, data solutions, manufacturing etc.).\nEU rules on sustainability disclosures apply horizontally across all industries equally and they do not single out a particular sector.\nThere is an explicit reference directly relevant for a limited part of the defence sector in one regulatory technical standard (RTS) under the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR), specifying further how financial market participants should disclose information about their principal adverse sustainability impacts (PAIs). This regulatory standard covers exposure to four categories of controversial weapons (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons, and biological weapons). For the remaining part of the RTS under the SFDR, the requirements (including on social aspects) are the same as for any other sector.\nSimilarly, the rules on MiFID/IDD sustainability preferences for retail investors apply horizontally across all industries equally and do not single out any specific sector. Therefore, they do not prevent investments in any specific sector. The principal adverse impacts taken into consideration in the financial product only concern the controversial weapons as referred to above.\nAs part of a broader work following up on the European Council conclusions of March 2022 to promote and facilitate access to private funding for the defence industry, the European Defence Agency launched in May 2022 a study to provide an overview of ESG frameworks applied on financial markets and how they regard defence industry or defence industry related activities. The aim is to measure and benchmark the European defence industry’s activities in relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, and provide an analysis of the sector’s contribution to the objectives set out by ESG-related frameworks."

  {
    "question": "How about companies without any Taxonomy-aligned activities? Will they lose access to finance?",
    "answer": "No. The mere fact that a company does not have Taxonomy-aligned activities does not mean that conclusions can be drawn regarding the company’s environmental performance or its ability to access finance.\nThere is also no obligation on companies to have activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy and there is no obligation on investors to invest in Taxonomy-aligned activities.\nOverall, there is likely to be a higher interest in Taxonomy-aligned activities from investors who are seeking sustainable investments.\nThere are several reasons why a company might not have economic activities that are eligible or aligned with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy: its economic activities might simply not be covered by the EU Taxonomy, or it may be covered but not make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective; or it might make a substantial contribution but not meet the do no significant harm criteria or the minimum social safeguards. Therefore, without knowing the exact reasons why a company has no Taxonomy-aligned activities, market participants cannot make investment decisions purely on the basis of Taxonomy-related disclosures of companies, because not having Taxonomy-aligned activities does not, in itself, reveal the company’s exact environmental performance. Instead, other disclosures, such as the company’s disclosures under the CSRD will help inform markets about the company’s environmental performance and the company’s direction of travel on environmental matters.\nJust as companies need to manage their portfolio of activities and should aim to gradually increase the share of green activities, similarly it can be expected that most investors will aim to gradually increase the share of sustainable investments in their portfolios. It is also important to keep in mind that financial market participants who are making decisions about allocating capital will take into account more elements than just the Taxonomy alignment. For all companies within the scope of the CSRD, even for companies not undertaking economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned, investors will have at their disposal both (i) Taxonomy disclosures, and (ii) the information reported according to the CSRD. Aside from legally binding disclosures, companies can also make voluntary disclosures. Investors may use all of these disclosures when making investment decisions and financial products. Investors are free to design their investments as they wish and will continue to make investment decisions taking into account a large number of factors."

    "question": "The DNSH criteria for pollution prevention and control of the activity “Afforestation” in Section 1.1. specify that the activity should minimise the use of fertilisers and not use manure. Should the use of natural fertilisers also be minimised?",
    "answer": "The DNSH criterion requires the minimisation of fertilisers by favouring the use of alternative approaches or techniques including non-chemical or natural fertilisers. In cases where non-chemical or natural fertilisers are used, their overall consumption should be kept at a minimum and take account of broader ecosystem impacts."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the term “degradation of land with high carbon stocks” in the activity “Afforestation” in Section 1.1. defined?",
    "answer": "The Climate Delegated Act defines land with high-carbon stock by referring to Article 29(4), points (a), (b) and (c) of RED II, which provides:\n“[…] land with high-carbon stock, namely land that had one of the following statuses in January 2008 and no longer has that status:\n(a) wetlands, namely land that is covered with or saturated by water permanently or for a significant part of the year;\n(b) continuously forested areas, namely land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of more than 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ;\n(c) land spanning more than one hectare with trees higher than five metres and a canopy cover of between 10 % and 30 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds in situ, unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that, when the methodology laid down in Part C of Annex V is applied, the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of this Article would be fulfilled.”\nThe Climate Delegated Act does not provide a definition of degradation. However, the overall purpose of the criterion is to maintain the high carbon stock and avoid GHG emissions from that stock."

    "question": "What does “in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law” mean in the context of the activity “Rehabilitation and restoration of forests” in Section 1.2.? What if national law does not require such consideration?",
    "answer": "In the context of point 1.2. (g) of the substantial contribution criteria to climate change mitigation of the activity\n“Rehabilitation and restoration of forests\n” in Section 1.2, the reference to a consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in national law regarding consideration of societal issues, is not further defined in the Climate Delegated Act.

  {
    "question": "What is the meaning of a “continuously updated” forest management plan? Does this mean renewed after the end of its validity, in the occurrence of significant events, or yearly? Or is it about having evidence of the work done in the forest?",
    "answer": "The frequency of updates of forest management plans is not defined in the TSC, allowing for a scope for reflecting national requirements. As mentioned in the FAO Sustainable Forest Management Toolbox\n(50)\nSee: www.fao.org/sustainable-forest-management/toolbox/modules/forest-management-planning/in-more-depth/en/\n, continuous improvement through accumulating learning is an integral part of sustainable forest management, and forest management plans need to be reviewed regularly and revised accordingly as conditions change. The continuity aspect also includes the need to ensure that there is no break in time between different forest management plan updates. In the case of a 10-year-long forest management plan, the frequency should be at least 10 years."

    "answer": "The criterion in point 2.3. (c) provides that\n\"the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used\"\n.\nThe criterion underlines that the climate benefit analysis needs to be tailored to the size of the area and the specific context, for example by using the growth assumptions associated with the specific soil and climatic conditions."

What are the requirements for an owner of a 14 hectare forest holding?",
    "answer": "The provisions in point 2.4 of Section 1.3 ”Forest management” exempt forest holdings under 13ha, which corresponds to the average size of a forest holding in Europe, from the requirement to perform a climate benefit analysis. The owner of a 14 hectare forest holding needs therefore to carry out such an analysis to comply with forest management criteria, unless he can demonstrate compliance with this requirement at forest sourcing area level, as specified in point 2.1."

  {
    "question": "What happens when the DNSH criteria are assessed at the level of the “group of holdings” and one of the members leaves during the expected lifespan of the activity? Such lifespan can be several decades for forestry activities, and there is no assurance that the group stays the same for such a long time.",
    "answer": "In case of group assessment, the Delegated Act requires that the group is sufficiently homogenous to allow the evaluation of risks, that the members of the group have a durable relationship and participate in the activity and that the group remains the same for the subsequent audits. The Delegated Act does not provide that the group assessment cannot be continued in the situation where a holding leaves the group that had criteria assessed at group level. If the remaining group can be reasonably expected to continue their common assessment and if the profile of the group and its homogeneity are not affected, the group would not have any additional burden of proof regarding homogeneity and could continue to carry out the verification as a group."

How should the term “good conservation status” in the DNSH criteria be interpreted?",
    "answer": "The main aim of this criterion is to be applicable independently of whether the activity takes place in a protected area or not, or deals with priority species under the Birds and Habitats Directives or not. The first paragraphs in the criterion deal specifically with protected areas.\nThe text preceding point (a) which includes the reference to “good conservation status” makes clear the need for “\nprovisions for maintaining and possibly enhancing biodiversity in accordance with national and local provisions\n”. This indicates that the term\n“good conservation status”\nas used in this criterion, can take different interpretations in accordance with national or local provisions, and was not intended as a reference to favourable conservation status as in the Birds and Habitats Directives."

    "question": "What does point (d) of the biodiversity DNSH criteria of the activity “Forest management” in Section 1.3. mean in practice when it refers to “improvement of physical, chemical and biological quality of the soil”?",
    "answer": "Soil has physical, chemical, and biological components. The physical components of soil include the rocks and minerals that over time have turned into very small particles of sand, silt and clay. The chemical components of soil include the pH, the various nutrients (e.g. nitrogen) and water. Finally, the biological components of soil include the animals, plants, protozoa, bacteria and fungi that live in the soil.\nIn practice, improvement of the physical, chemical and biological components of the soil requires various techniques including those that avoid soil compaction, prevent soil erosion and runoff, and provide the right conditions for beneficial organisms to multiply in the soil, e.g. by leaving sufficient amounts of coarse and fine woody debris."

    "answer": "Forests are biologically diverse systems and offer a variety of habitats for plants, animals, fungi and micro-organisms.\nIn practice, restoration and conservation of biodiversity and habitats in forests would require various practices that maintain and enhance structural complexity and promote natural dynamics adapted to local conditions. Some of these practices include for example setting areas aside, establishing buffer zones for waterbody protection, ensuring appropriate volume and diversity of deadwood and presence of habitat trees and other microhabitats, promoting natural regeneration and diversifying tree species and the age structure of the holding.

    "answer": "Forest ecosystems differ in terms of types of habitats, number of species and species diversity that they provide.\nThe main aim of this criterion is to ensure that a high-biodiverse ecosystem retains its status and is not converted to a less biodiverse one, as a consequence of forest management practices. This can include conversion of the forest type by reducing the species diversity of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants and the associated fauna, as well as the conversion of high-biodiverse non-forest ecosystems into less biodiverse forest ones.\nIn practice, conservation of a high-biodiverse ecosystem would require various practices, adapted to local conditions.

    "answer": "To be classified as Taxonomy-aligned, an economic activity should fulfil the respective TSC for substantial contribution and DNSH and comply with the minimum safeguards.\nThe TSC for the activity “Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport” in Section 3.3. for the environmental objective of climate change mitigation are as follows:\n“The economic activity manufactures, repairs, maintains, retrofits, repurposes or upgrades: […]\n(f) vehicles of category M1 and N1 classified as light-duty vehicles with:\n(i) until 31 December 2025: specific emissions of CO2, as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council, lower than 50gCO2/km (low- and zero-emission light-duty vehicles);\n(ii) from 1 January 2026: specific emissions of CO2, as defined in Article 3(1), point (h), of Regulation (EU) 2019/631, are zero;\n(g) vehicles of category L with tailpipe CO2 emissions equal to 0g CO2/km calculated in accordance with the emission test laid down in Regulation (EU) 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n;\nThe Climate Delegated Act only refers to the EU regulations setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles. The CO2 Regulation refers to the EU Emission Type Approval Regulation\n(51)\nCommission Regulation (EU) 2017/1151  of 1 June 2017 supplementing Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information, amending Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 1230/2012 and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 (OJ L 175, 7.7.2017, p. 1–643).\nwhich defines the test procedure (WLTP) for measuring the CO2 emissions of light-duty vehicles. The EU Taxonomy related disclosures comprise the global activities of EU companies, and they are not limited to EU turnover, CapEx and OpEx. Cars/vans produced/sold outside the EU are not necessarily tested under WLTP (not EU type approved passenger cars). The Climate Delegated Act does not contain any guidance on how to deal with such vehicles.\nSince the Taxonomy only sets values based on the WLTP test procedure, it does not provide specific rules for vehicles that are type-approved under other systems. While a large proportion of vehicles sold globally are registered in countries using type-approval systems based on WLTP, e.g. UNECE Regulation 154\n(52)\nSee: https://unece.org/transport/documents/2021/02/standards/un-regulation-no-154-worldwide-harmonized-light-vehicles-test\n, and can therefore provide proof of compliance with this requirement, a still significant proportion of vehicles sold globally cannot provide proof of such compliance. Relevant certification procedures other than WLTP include the US CAFE, Japan’s JC08 or the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle, no longer in use in the EU but still applicable in some jurisdictions). For the purpose of proving compliance with this criterion, the manufacturing of vehicles certified under systems other than EU type approval and marketed in a third country can be considered as Taxonomy-aligned if the vehicle meets the Taxonomy criteria following the application of a duly documented and scientifically valid conversion factor."

    "question": "Can curtain walling be used to qualify for taxonomy-alignment under Section 3.5?",
    "answer": "Yes, in the Delegated Act,\n“curtain wall”\ncan be understood as a\n“non-load bearing wall”\n, in line with its use in (EN) ISO 12631, which covers both opaque and non-opaque elements. We recognise the proposed U-value for walling systems might be very difficult to meet by curtain walls that are fully (or almost fully) glazed.\nThe latter (fully or almost fully glazed walls) could qualify as window products under the respective U-value. In principle, for fully (or almost fully) glazed and transparent curtain walls, i.e. those for which at least 80% of the surface is glazed and transparent, it is necessary to apply the proposed U-value for windows."

What household appliances fall under these classes? Could the EPREL database be used to obtain the information?",
    "answer": "The requirement targets the two highest classes of energy efficiency that are populated, in which at least some products are on the market. To understand which classes are the highest populated in which at least some products are on the market, an overview of the available products on the market (based on official data) is provided by a reference database named EPREL (European Product Database for Energy Labelling)\n(53)\nSee: https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/home\n."

    "question": "How should “substantial” be defined in the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Manufacture of other low carbon technologies” in Section 3.6.in that refer to “substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings”? Which data should be used as evidence for the comparison?",
    "answer": "As the activity in Section 3.6 of Annex I refers to other low carbon technologies not covered in Sections 3.1 to 3.5, the TSC can refer to several activities across a range of sectors. Their precise application leaves some flexibility and depends on the activity in question. Consequently, there is no common performance level implied by the criterion of\n\"substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings compared to the best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market\"\n. Operators of the activity should justify whether and how their technology enables the achievement of substantial GHG reductions in other sectors compared to other competing technologies. In this, they should ensure that their assessment is consistent with any credible, available external sources of information on the potential of the technology to help achieve decarbonisation of the target activity, in line with the EU Climate Law or Paris Agreement objectives. Undertakings should also demonstrate this element for the purpose of the third-party verification required by the TSC and, notably undertakings subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, should disclose all relevant information as part of their non-financial statement."

    "question": "For instance, can the manufacturing of equipment for traffic management and tolling be considered as Taxonomy-eligible under the activity “Manufacture of other low carbon technologies” in Section 3.6.?",
    "answer": "The activity could be eligible under Section 3.6. of Annex I. For the purpose of Taxonomy-alignment, the activity would have to prove that it delivers GHG emissions savings compared to the best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market (in this case, compared to other equipment for traffic management and tolling). If there are several possible uses, savings would have to occur for all potential uses.\nFor an indicative guide on the types of activities that could qualify under the Delegated Act based on the different industry classification systems, one may consider consulting the ‘\nNACE alternate classification mapping’\npublished by the Platform on Sustainable Finance\n(54)\nSee:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/files/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-nace-alternate-classification-mapping_en\n.

    "question": "Are the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of aluminium” regarding indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fulfilled only if 100% of renewable energy is used in the manufacture of aluminium or does the electricity user need to document the carbon intensity of indirect GHG emissions (for example by purchasing Guarantees of Origin)?",
    "answer": "Until 2025, operators are required to comply with only two out of the three conditions set out in point (a) of the TSC for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in Section 3.8. in order to be considered as substantially contributing to that objective.\nAfter 2025, all three conditions laid out in Section 3.8 of Annex I should be met in order for the activity to be considered as substantially contributing to the climate change mitigation. The requirement regarding indirect GHG emissions is that the average carbon intensity for the indirect GHG emissions does not exceed 100g CO2e/kWh. By analogy to the 100gCO2e/kWh threshold for substantial contribution in certain energy sectors, this requirement does, therefore, not mean that only renewable energy may be used to comply with this criterion."

  {
    "question": "How should the provisions in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of iron and steel” in Section 3.9 referring to the attribution of emissions for the production and use of waste gases be interpreted?",
    "answer": "The criteria for the manufacture of iron and steel referred to in point (a) of the TSC for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in Section 3.9. specify that GHG emissions should be\n“reduced by the amount of emissions assigned to the production of waste gases in accordance with point 10.1.5(a) of Annex VII to Regulation (EU) 2019/331”.\nThis means that the emissions attributed to the production of waste gases are not taken into consideration for the purpose of the criteria for steel laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Notably, the requirement means that manufacturers of steel can calculate the emission attributed to the production of waste gases according to the free allocation rules (which consider these waste gases explicitly). However, for the purpose of compliance with the TSC, they are discounted.  The calculation of the activity’s emissions does therefore not take into account these emissions attributed to the generation of waste gases."

    "question": "How are the GHG emission thresholds specified in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of iron and steel” in Section 3.9. applied? For example, does the manufacture of hot metal (1,331 tCO2e/t product) include the provision of coke (0,144 tCO2e/t product) or is the GHG emission threshold to be applied exclusively for the hot metal manufacturing process step?",
    "answer": "The definitions of the processes and emissions covered by the different screening criteria (i.e. system boundaries) are given in Annex I to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331. The production of coke is not included in the system boundaries of hot metal."
  },

  {
    "question": "How is the emission threshold for hydrogen used in different processes for the manufacture of hydrogen under Section 3.10?",
    "answer": "The Climate Delegated Act recognises hydrogen as an energy carrier, storage solution, fuel or feedstock. In line with the technology-neutrality requirement referred to in point (a) of Article 19(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the manufacture of hydrogen is not restricted to specific production pathways or technology. Any production of hydrogen that demonstrates meeting the life-cycle GHG emission savings of 73.4% in comparison to the fossil fuel comparator of 94gCO2e/MJ in analogy with Article 25(2) and Annex V of RED II can be considered substantially contributing to climate change mitigation.\nIn line with the approach taken for defining DNSH to climate change mitigation, the Climate Delegated Act draws on the level of ambition of existing Union legislation. Annex II sets out that the production of hydrogen is considered not doing significant harm, if it achieves at least the GHG emission savings level enshrined in RED II."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the reference to RED II in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Manufacture of hydrogen” in Section 3.10. imply that the RED II additionality requirement applies?",
    "answer": "The Climate Delegated Act does not include requirements for additionality. However, this matter is relevant in the context of the implementation of RED II and may affect the types of hydrogen that qualify as renewable (i.e. the type of electricity can be considered renewable for the production of hydrogen) and may also be relevant for determining the GHG emission intensity of renewable hydrogen."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the life cycle emissions assessed and calculated for the activity “Manufacture of hydrogen” in Section 3.10.? For example, is the manufacture of the equipment taken into account when assessing life cycle emissions?",
    "answer": "The Climate Delegated Act sets out the relative GHG emission savings requirement in comparison to the fossil fuel comparator by analogy with Article 25(2) and Annex V of RED II.\nSimilar to the approach pursued for electricity and heat generation activities, the Climate Delegated Act enables the use of alternative methodologies to calculate life-cycle GHG emissions. In line with ISO standards, the alternative calculation methodology in case of hydrogen production is the one referred to in Article 28(5) of RED II.\nThe Commission is preparing a delegated act setting out a methodology for determining the GHG emissions savings of renewable fuels of non-biological origin and recycled carbon fuels, which includes renewable hydrogen (except hydrogen derived from biogenic sources) and certain types of low carbon hydrogen."

    "question": "For the activity “Electricity generation from hydropower” in Section 4.5., what does the power density threshold of the electricity generation facility above 5 W/m2 mean in practice?",
    "answer": "Power density of hydropower plants describes the relation between the installed capacity of the power production and impounded area. According to the International Hydropower Association’s GHG emission data\n(55)\nInternational Hydropower Association, Hydropower Status Report 2018. See p.29. of Sector trends and insights available at: https://hydropower-assets.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/publications-docs/iha_2018_hydropower_status_report_4.pdf\n, hydropower plants above 5W/m2 do not emit more than 100gCO2e/kWh. This finding has been used to exempt power plants with a higher power density from having to carry out the life-cycle assessment (along with run-of-river plants)."

  {
    "question": "What does “where relevant” in the criteria for DNSH to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources of the activity “Electricity generation from hydropower” in Section 4.5. mean in practice and who assesses what measures are relevant?",
    "answer": "The DNSH criteria for hydropower list all possible (generic) mitigation measures which must be considered in all cases. However, the implementation of these criteria for hydropower is context specific. The objective is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, to protect ecosystems and water bodies, and, on the other hand, avoiding putting an excessive administrative burden on hydropower operators. Therefore, in an individual case, a specific analysis should be performed based on the list of all measures to identify those that are appropriate. Only measures that are relevant to the ecological conditions of the project should be implemented.\nThe relevance of specific DNSH criteria and mitigation measures listed therein will depend on a case-by-case assessment in terms of feasibility and relevance, taking into account the broader hydro-morphological context, including the state of the ecological flow and the requirement to attain and maintain a good ecological status, or where applicable good ecological potential, of the relevant water bodies. The reference conditions for good status or good potential for water bodies differ according to the relevant ecoregion (geographical area identified in Annex XI of the Water Framework Directive). These conditions are relevant for determining the necessary and relevant mitigation measures aimed at achieving these objectives."

  {
    "question": "What is meant by the ‘compensatory measures’ in point 3.5 of the DNSH criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources of the activity “Electricity generation from hydropower” in Section 4.5.? What examples of these measures could be provided?",
    "answer": "Compensatory measures are measures to restore continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity and associated impacts on aquatic ecosystems caused by the hydropower development for which compliance with TSC is claimed, for example, by removing dams or other barriers elsewhere in the river basin district. Environmental benefits stemming from the compensatory measures are proportionate to the extent of the impacts. The relevance and type of such compensatory measures are not further detailed since they require a case-by-case assessment in terms of feasibility and relevance."

    "question": "Is there an absolute requirement that hydropower production should allow for reaching the objectives of good status or good potential of water bodies, for both new and existing hydropower production, in order to fulfil the DNSH-criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources?",
    "answer": "There is an absolute requirement to put in place all technically and ecologically relevant measures towards achieving good ecological status or good ecological potential of water bodies in line with the definition of the Water Framework Directive. For both new and existing hydropower production the DNSH criterion for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources provides that:\n“In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water”\nand\n“The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.”\nIn addition, for new hydropower production, it is indicated that\n“The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district.” (point 3.4. of Section 4.5.)"
  },
  {
    "question": "The Delegated Act requires that hydropower operates in accordance with an authorisation or permit aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body. Does that mean that: i. there is an absolute requirement that all hydropower production require a permit/licence/authorisation; and ii. all licenses/permits/authorisations should refer to the environmental objectives for the affected water bodies? Does this also mean that the DNSH-criteria require creating conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body?",
    "answer": "All hydropower production requires a permit/licence/authorisation aiming at achieving good ecological status or good ecological potential of the affected water body in line with the definitions of the Water Framework Directive.  In addition, as provided in point 2.3 of Section 4.5. of the DNSH to sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\n“the effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.”"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can hydropower production implying the application of Article 4(5) of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (less stringent objectives) be considered to fulfil the DNSH criteria?",
    "answer": "In principle, a body of water affected by a hydropower plant would have been converted into a\n‘heavily modified water body’\nin accordance with Article 4(3) WFD. That implies that it should strive towards reaching good ecological potential rather than good status. According to the WFD, derogations under Article 4(5) WFD could apply if a water body is affected by hydropower and it would be disproportionately costly or technically impossible to achieve good potential. Should such a plant nevertheless decide to apply all technically possible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures to reach good ecological potential, and be subject to a permit to monitor and control those ecologically relevant measures, it may still fulfil the DNSH criteria.\nThis would however imply that the water body would aim towards good status or good potential and, therefore, that the derogation under Article 4(5) WFD should be reviewed at the next revision of the relevant river basin management plan. A water body, which on the contrary would remain under the (initial) ‘lowered’ objective under Article 4(5) of WFD without putting in place the necessary measures (ecologically and technically relevant) towards good potential, does not fulfil the DNSH criteria."

    "question": "How should the best available techniques (BAT-AEL) ranges referenced in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Electricity generation from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels” in Section 4.7. be applied in non-EU jurisdictions?",
    "answer": "BAT-AEL ranges could be applied internationally since the ranges are not based on EU legislation. BAT-AELs describe a range of emission levels obtained under normal operating conditions using a best alternative technique (BAT) or a combination of best alternative techniques as described in BAT conclusions. They are expressed as an average over a given period of time under specified reference conditions."

    "answer": "The emission intensity of newly enabled generation capacities as well as the average system grid emission factor are based on historical emissions and power generation. The 100gCO2/kWh applies to this historical data, on a rolling five-year period."

    "question": "Is hydrogen included as part of the activity “Storage of electricity” in Section 4.10?",
    "answer": "Storage of hydrogen is included in Section 4.12 of Annex I as a distinct activity with its own criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and for DNSH.\nThe storage of hydrogen is considered as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if it consists in the construction of new or conversion of existing storage dedicated to hydrogen, or if it consists in the operation of storage when the hydrogen stored is produced in line with the respective criteria defined for the manufacture of hydrogen."

    "answer": "No, there is no direct link between the two activities. It might be that a “guarantee for hydrogen” might exist in the future as the hydrogen market develops, with improved traceability. Under the TEN-E Regulation which identifies trans-European energy infrastructure priorities, hydrogen infrastructure ‘Projects of Common Interest’ need to demonstrate that they contribute significantly to sustainability, including by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, by enhancing the deployment of renewable or low-carbon hydrogen, with an emphasis on hydrogen from renewable sources."

  {
    "question": "Can the use of dry sludge from a non-industrial urban water treatment plant (without prior digestion and without mixing) be considered as biomass? If considered as biomass, would an incineration facility with energy recovery in the form of electricity and heat, dedicated exclusively to the burning of this sludge be Taxonomy-eligible?",
    "answer": "According to the definition of biomass in Article 2(24) of RED II, biomass is defined as\n‘the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from biological origin from agriculture, including vegetal and animal substances, from forestry and related industries, including fisheries and aquaculture, as well as the biodegradable fraction of waste, including industrial and municipal waste of biological origin.’\nAccording to this definition, dry sludge from a non-industrial urban water treatment plan can be considered biomass.\nHowever, from the perspective of classifying activities as ‘environmentally sustainable’, the Taxonomy Regulation specifically states in its Article 17(1)(d) that any\n‘activity that leads to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste’\nis considered to cause significant harm to the environment.\nOn this basis, Article 17(1)(d) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation applies to measures related to both incineration and co-incineration of waste, notably in waste-to-energy plants and cement plants, and measures related to the construction of new such plants, increasing existing capacities or extending their lifetime. Thus, these activities - with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste – cannot meet the TSC. This would include an incineration facility with energy recovery in the form of electricity and heat, dedicated exclusively to the burning of dry sludge from a non-industrial urban water treatment plant."

    "answer": "Sections 5.1 and 5.3 of the Climate Delegated Act are targeted at the delivery of drinking water and the treatment of waste water. Therefore, in order to qualify as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation under the Taxonomy Regulation, the designers/operators of a drinking water/waste water system are responsible for ensuring that the system meets the technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.1. and 5.3 of Annex I.\nManufacture of products for commercial and residential pools would not qualify under the Sections 5.1 and 5.3 of Annex I as their main purpose does not contribute to delivering drinking water or ensuring the treatment of waste water."

    "answer": "As specified in the substantial contribution criteria in point 1 of Section 5.3.\n“Net energy consumption of the operation of the waste water treatment plant may take into account […] as appropriate, energy generation within the system (such as hydraulic, solar, thermal and wind energy).”\nThe list specified is a non-exhaustive list.\nThe energy generated through anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge falls within the scope of energy generation within the system, even if not explicitly mentioned."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does the activity “Material recovery from non-hazardous waste” in Section 5.9. also cover sorting facilities where final recycling or recovery is carried out in a different facility or country?",
    "answer": "The activity does not cover pure sorting facilities. Instead, it covers those facilities that carry out recycling of separately collected waste, whereas part of the process is often an initial ‘sorting’ step, e.g. to separate plastics and metals in case of co-mingled separately collected waste, or to separate different types of plastics such as PET, HDPE, PP.\nThe Climate Delegated Act prioritises the material recovery aspect as this has the greater potential to reduce GHG emissions, i.e. by replacing virgin material in production."

    "question": "What does “the highest populated classes” based on an official dataset mean regarding tyres?",
    "answer": "The technical screening criteria target the two highest classes for rolling resistance (influencing energy efficiency) that are populated, in which at least some tyres are on the market. To understand which classes are the highest populated in which at least some tyres are on the market, an overview of the available products on the market (based on official data) is provided by a reference database named EPREL (European Product Database for Energy Labelling). Public information on tyres is available from https://eprel.ec.europa.eu/screen/product/tyres. For instance, for severe snow conditions tyres for vans with size 195R15C, the highest performing tyres in rolling resistance (energy efficiency) are ranked class D (at the time of writing)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are “the highest populated classes” of tyres determined by dimension or categories?",
    "answer": "The highest populated classes should be determined for the specific tyre dimension and properties (the tyres that could be actually fitted on the vehicle, and including the three peak mountains snowflake (\n) pictogram if use of the vehicle is for severe snow conditions).  The information can be checked in the EPREL. The class for a whole category would be meaningless, as the class for the same brand and model can change based on the tyre size: for every different size, classes for rolling resistance coefficient, wet grip and noise can be different."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is comparison of tyre Fuel Efficiency, Wet Grip and Rolling Noise classes done across all tyres or separately within tyre categories, e.g. winter, all-season, and summer tyres?",
    "answer": "Comparison is done within a specific tyre category, meaning tyre size and certified special properties. Tyres with the three peak mountains snowflake (\n) pictogram can be specifically selected (those that are also for ice can be selected). Beyond this, distinctions do not exist for “winter” “all-season” or “summer” (however, arguably a tyre marketed “all-season” but without the three peak mountains snowflake pictogram would not have sufficient performance in severe snow conditions). For example tyres of size “205/55 R16” from the same brand and with the same tread design (thus same seasonality as well) may have different classes for the 3 parameters depending on the speed category index or other aspects (e.g. specifically designed for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or another OEM). All necessary parameters (size designation, load capacity index, speed category, season) have to be entered in EPREL for a correct comparison of the selected tyres."

  {
    "question": "Do the tyre screening criteria for M and N vehicles apply to the whole European market or are there country-specific criteria?",
    "answer": "The tyre technical screening criteria for M and N vehicles derive from an EU regulation and as such apply to the European market, with no country-specific variation. As for any criteria in the delegated act, compliance with these criteria would also be required for activities taking place outside of the EU. C1, C2 and C3 tyres are registered with the tyre class indicated."

    "answer": "While applying this criterion to exclude assets, operations and infrastructure that are dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels, it is necessary to take into account the multiple uses, different ownerships, user arrangements and fuels blending rates, in line with the relevant existing market practices. The consideration should inter alia include the type of mobile asset or infrastructure under consideration and their other uses, including whether it is intended to be used also for transport and storage of low-carbon alternatives.\nFor example, for maritime transport, whilst it is possible to clearly identify crude oil tankers as exclusively providing for the fossil fuel market, the same cannot be assumed for product, chemical tankers, or vessels carrying dry bulk products. The latter are vessel types which can be used for the transport of non-fossil fuel products and should not be excluded outright.\nDepending on the planned use and context, relevant existing market practices referred to in recital (35) of the Climate Delegated Act could be for example those used by the European Investment Bank\n(56)\nFor project finance, in the context of the ambitious climate assessment. Dedicated is defined as built and acquired with the explicit intention to predominantly transport or store fossil fuels over the life of the project.\nor by Climate Bonds Initiative\n(57)\nDedicated is defined by transport mode, e.g. in case more than 25% of the freight in t-km transported by the line is comprised of fossil fuels or more than 25% of the rolling stock is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or 25% of tonnage transported annually is fossil fuels (threshold declines geometrically at 5.3% from the year 2020 onwards). See: https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/CBI%20Transport%20Criteria%20document_Aug2022%281%29.pdf  also: https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/standards/Waterborne%20Transport%20%28Shipping%29/CBI%20Certification%20-%20Shipping%20Criteria%20V1b%2020211215.pdf and: https://www.climatebonds.net/files/files/CBI Transport Criteria document_Jan2020(1).pdf\n. For example, in the case of\nfreight rail transport\nin Section 6.2., universal wagons that are acquired specifically for the transport of coal would fail to meet the criterion of not being dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels.\nIn all cases, turnover derived from transporting fossil fuels by assets that are not dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels should be excluded from the numerator of the turnover KPI under the Disclosures Delegated Act."

    "question": "Is ammonia considered as a zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuel?",
    "answer": "Ammonia (NH3) is by definition carbon-free and it does not emit any CO2 emissions when combusted or used in a fuel cell. It can therefore be considered as a zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuel.\nIt is however important to note that, when ammonia is used together with hydrocarbon oil fuels used for piloting/ignition, namely in marine internal combustion engines, there will be an associated presence of CO2 emissions derived from multi-fuel combustion process."

    "question": "Do particularly low CO2 diesel locomotives classify as transitional technology in the description of the activities “Passenger interurban rail transport” in Section 6.1. and “Freight transport” in Section 6.2.?",
    "answer": "The Climate Delegated Act does not classify technologies. According to the criteria in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of Annex I that define substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, for any locomotive to qualify, it should be able to operate on zero direct tailpipe CO2 emissions. Any locomotive producing emissions, including low CO2 emissions, that does not comply with the requirement for having zero tailpipe CO2 emissions when operated on a track with necessary infrastructure (i.e. that is not bi-mode) does not therefore comply with the criteria.  Bi-mode locomotives which have zero tailpipe emissions when operated on electrified tracks but can be run on diesel where tracks are not electrified qualify as a transitional activity."

    "question": "Vehicle category N1 (classified as vehicle for good transport) is covered in the activity “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles” in Section 6.5., as well as in the activity “Freight transport services by road” in Section 6.6. Why is N1 covered in both activities? What are the differences?",
    "answer": "Vehicle category N1 are vans, i.e. motor vehicles designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of goods with a maximum mass under 3.5 tons. However, their emissions can be regulated under two different regimes, depending on the “reference mass” of the vehicles concerned. In most cases, vehicles with a reference mass of less than 2610 kg, have to follow the ”light-duty vehicle” type approval rules (for CO2 and pollutant emissions – Euro 6 Regulation (EC) No 715/2007) which also apply for cars and are subject to the CO2 fleet standards. N1 vehicles with a reference mass exceeding 2610 kg normally have to follow the “heavy-duty vehicle” emission type approval rules (Euro VI Regulation (EC) No 595/2009) and are generally not subject to CO standards.\nFor this reason, the description in Activity in Section 6.6 is as follows: “\nPurchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of vehicles designated as category N1, N2 (240) or N3 (241) falling under the scope of EURO VI (242), step E or its successor, for freight transport services by road.\n” In this way, all vehicles type-approved with the light duty framework (cars and vans with a reference mass below 2610 kg) will be covered in Section 6.5, while some N.1 (vans that use the above mention derogation) will be covered in Section 6.6."

    "answer": "N1 vehicles either fall under the provisions of Section 6.5 or Section 6.6 of Annex I,  depending on whether they fall under the provisions of Euro 6 (Regulation (EC) No 715/2007) or the provisions of Euro VI (Regulation (EC) No 595/2009), therefore different mass thresholds apply. The scope of application of those Regulations is determined by the reference mass of the vehicles concerned.\nM1 vehicles fall only under the provisions of Section 6.5 (passenger cars and light commercial vehicles), referring to Euro 6 (Regulation (EC) No 715/2007) and thus covering only vehicles with a reference mass not exceeding 2 610 kg."

    "question": "What is the scope of “chartering” with or without a crew as referred to in the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10.?",
    "answer": "The Delegated Act does not define chartering. However, this is a well-established terminology in commercial shipping practice, used by all major organisations, such as the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) or the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO).\nShip chartering is the hiring out of a ship by a ship owner to another company, the charterer, for the transportation of goods over a limited and well-defined period of time.\nThe two main parties in ship chartering are the ship owner and the charterer.  Other parties can include the ship broker who negotiates deals between ship owners and charterers, the shipping agent who takes care of the essential in-port details and the ship manager, who takes care of operating and crewing the vessel on behalf of the owner for a fee.\nThe charter party, i.e. the contract, defines the rate, duration, and terms agreed between the ship owner and the charterer. Many different types of charter contracts exist in practice:\nVoyage Charter - basic hiring of a vessel and its crew for a voyage between the port of loading and the port of discharge known as a voyage charter. In this type of contract, the ship owner is paid by the charterer either on a per-ton basis, or as a lump sum. Port costs, with the exception of stevedoring, fuel costs, and the crew costs are paid by the owner, and payment for the use of the vessel is known as freight.\nTime Charter - hiring of a vessel for a specific period of time, where the owner still manages the ship, but the charterer selects the ports, decides the routing, and has full operational control of the vessel for the duration of the contract. It pays the fuel costs, port charges, cargo handling costs, commissions, and a daily hire fee.\nBareboat Charter – chartering arrangement where charterer has full control of the vessel. Apart from the capital cost of building the vessel, which is the owner’s responsibility, all other costs including fuel, crew, port charges and insurance, are paid by the charterer. The legal and financial responsibility for the vessel rests with the charterer."

    "question": "How is alignment with the technical screening criteria of the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10. demonstrated by undertakings chartering or operating vessels?",
    "answer": "The demonstration of Taxonomy-alignment by undertakings chartering or operating vessels should be made on a basis of the relevant provisions in the chartering contract.\nSuch demonstration could typically be the responsibility of the undertaking that was granted financing based on Taxonomy-alignment, in accordance with the relevant TSC. If this was granted to the owner of the ship, then the relevant responsibility of the charterer, or operator, would be to present all the information on fuel purchased to the owner, who has responsibility vis-à-vis the financing institution. If, on the other hand, the financing was provided to the charterer, to cover OpEx, then the relevant responsibility to demonstrate Taxonomy-alignment, would be on the charterer directly towards the financing institution.\nAs regards the mandatory disclosures pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the undertaking that generates revenues and/or incurs CapEx and/or OpEx related to this activity should assess their Taxonomy-eligibility and Taxonomy-alignment and report this in its KPIs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the “best in class” criterion referred to in the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10. covering?",
    "answer": "Given that for shipping technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives are not yet commercially available, it qualifies as a transitional activity referred to in Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. The “best in class”\ncriterion in this context captures that a compliant ship: (a) has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector; (b) does not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives; and (c) does not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets.\nThe “best in class” criterion accordingly allows certain vessels to comply with the substantial contribution criteria even though the vessels do not have zero direct CO2 tailpipe emissions until the end of 2025. This is particularly the case in paragraph 1(d) of Section 6.10., according to which the vessels need to have attained an EEDI value 10% below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022. The vessels have to be able to run on zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (that meet the technical screening criteria specified in Sections 3.10 and 4.13 of Annex I), to prove that there is no lock-in of carbon-intensive assets."

  {
    "question": "For the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” in Section 6.10., does a vessel have to run on zero direct emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources in order to be Taxonomy-aligned, or is it sufficient that the vessel is certified for fuels from renewable sources such as biofuels?",
    "answer": "The substantial contribution criteria in Section 6.10. of Annex I specify four alternative ways to demonstrate compliance. In particular, for the criterion specified in point (1.d), a vessel, having an attained Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) value 10% below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022, should be able to\ninter alia\nrun on zero CO2 emission or renewable fuels that comply with the criteria in Section 3.10 “Hydrogen and h2-based synthetic fuels” or in Section 4.13 “Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids” of Annex I.\nThe attained EEDI reference is the main criterion in this point (1.d) in Section 6.10 of Annex I. The ability to run on zero direct CO2 emission or renewable fuels represents an enabling provision in the criterion which does not impose, or further specify, which type of fuel to be used.\nFurthermore, the criterion does not impose further limitation on the use of different types of fuels during operation. In practice, the verification of the enabling condition is made with reference to the energy conversion system installed on board, rather than the fuel used.\nAs an example, a vessel equipped with dual fuel gas engines is able to use liquefied natural gas (LNG), but would also be “able to use” either liquefied bio or synthetic methane.\nThus, for compliance with the TSC, it is sufficient that the vessel meets the minimum EEDI requirements and is equipped and certified with energy conversion systems able to run with fuels that comply with the criteria in Section 3.10. or 4.13."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are vessels operated with biofuels included in the zero tailpipe CO2 emission criterion of the activity “Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities” (Section 6.10.)?",
    "answer": "No, they are not. The reference to zero direct tailpipe emissions in the TSC does not prejudge the type of fuel selected. Internal combustion engines, whether using biofuels or other, have, as a rule, direct CO2 emissions, whether associated to the main fuel used or to piloting fuels used for ignition. Any vessel with such emissions does not comply with the requirement for having zero tailpipe CO2 emissions. Also, fuel cell installations, if using fuel other than hydrogen or ammonia will have CO2 emissions associated to the fuel reforming process.\nZero direct tailpipe emissions must be demonstrated based on the technological choices made for the propulsion installation.\nWithout considering the possibility of on-board carbon capture and storage (OCCS) the only possible options for zero tailpipe CO2 emissions would be technological solutions, such as:\nElectric ships, operated on an all-electrical configuration, with energy stored in batteries;\nHydrogen Fuel Cell installations, with hydrogen or hydrogen carrier as source of energy;\nAmmonia Fuel Cell installations, with ammonia as source of energy;\ndifferent combinations of renewable energy sources, directly used in propulsion assistance (e.g. wind assisted propulsion) or as energy source for electricity production (wind generators or photovoltaic)."

    "answer": "A ship can be outside the scope of EEDI when:\nit is not meeting the relevant size and deadweight provisions in MARPOL Annex VI, Chapter 4, regulations 19 and 24, respectively;\nit is not being part of the ship types covered by EEDI (MARPOL Annex VI, Chapter 4, regulation 24).\nAccording to footnote 261 of Annex I, vessels that fall into the ship types set out in MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 2, but are not considered as new ships under that Regulation may provide attained EEDI value calculated on a voluntary basis in line with MARPOL Annex VI Chapter 4 and have those calculations verified in line with MARPOL Annex VI, Chapter 2.\nFor any ship outside the group of ship types considered for EEDI calculation, irrespective of the size or deadweight, it is not possible to apply EEDI methodology and, therefore, only the applicable criteria of (1.a) and (1.b) of Section 6.10 of Annex I would apply.\nFinally, and, in particular, for vessels of smaller size and deadweight, it is very likely that the adoption of all electrical solutions or hydrogen fuel cell systems may be adopted. EEDI would not work in such cases and the applicable criteria for such vessels are included in points (1.a) and (1.b) of Section 6.10 of Annex I."

Does it include intelligent transport systems (ITS) enabling for example traffic flow optimisation and facilitation of energy efficiency in road transport?",
    "answer": "In order to be regarded as included in Section 6.15 of Annex I, infrastructure must either be dedicated to the operation of road vehicles with zero tailpipe CO2 emissions, or be dedicated to urban and suburban public passenger transport, i.e. regular passenger transport services of general economic interest provided to the public on a non-discriminatory and continuous basis.

Are nationally established assessment procedures permitted for proof of conformity if they currently have the limitations, but at the same time are largely established in practice (for example, in building assessment systems, in the allocation of housing subsidies)?",
    "answer": "As specified in footnote 286 of Annex I, the GWP is communicated as a numeric indicator for each life cycle stage expressed as kgCO2e/m2 (of useful internal floor area) averaged for one year of a reference study period of 50 years. The data selection, scenario definition and calculations are carried out in accordance with EN 15978 (EN 15978:2011. Sustainability of construction works. Assessment of environmental performance of buildings. Calculation method). The scope of building elements and technical equipment is as defined in the Level(s) common EU framework for indicator 1.2.\nWhere a national calculation tool exists, or is required for making disclosures or for obtaining building permits, the respective tool may be used to provide the required disclosure.

    "question": "Is dedicated building land for the new construction of buildings no longer considered arable and cultivated land, regardless of the soil fertility of the land that is still undeveloped? Or is it generally prohibited in the sense of the ordinance to construct a new building on arable and cultivated land with medium to high soil fertility and subsurface biodiversity, regardless of its dedication under building law?",
    "answer": "The purpose of including the DNSH criterion for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems is to ensure that new construction does no significant harm to land types that have a high biodiversity and ecosystem value. More specifically, their purpose is that the three land types identified by the DNSH criterion are not converted to land for construction purposes.\nOn this basis, any project involving new construction on arable land and crop land with a moderate to high level of soil fertility and below ground biodiversity is considered to do significant harm to biodiversity and ecosystems."

    "question": "The substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. indicate that the energy performance is certified using an ‘as built Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)’. What is meant by ‘as built’? Can during the construction phase a calculated estimated primary energy demand (PED) be used to determine Taxonomy-alignment until the final energy performance assessment has been performed? If during the construction phase the calculated estimated PED value is only available on building level and not on individual building unit level (which is often the case for apartments), can the PED value for the total building be used as a proxy for the PED of the individual apartment during the construction phase?",
    "answer": "For new buildings, either an EPC (valid for 10 years) or an EPC as-built are valid. It is understood that often for construction projects the loan is provided before the works start and funds are made available as the works progress. Since it is not possible to obtain the EPC as-built until the very end of the project, it should be possible as a provisional measure to obtain and use an EPC as-designed. This would allow the building process to start. However, upon completion of the works, there needs to be an EPC as-built to certify that indeed the building complied with the criterion 10% better than NZEB.\nThis depends also on the availability of the EPCs and the scope of the project as such. When the project concerns a whole building, there is no need to check the EPC for each individual apartment. When the project is about construction or acquisition/ownership of an apartment, the EPC for the respective apartment can be used."

    "answer": "The criterion for DNSH to mitigation in Section 7.1. of Annex II means to exclude as Taxonomy-aligned the adaptation activities for buildings that are dedicated to certain activities involving fossil fuels. This criterion does not exclude from fulfilling the DNSH criterion buildings where small quantities of fuels might need to be stored or transported, e.g. for ensuring the functioning of the on-site energy production facilities, but where the building is dedicated to a completely different use (for example, residential building)."

What testing methodology needs to be performed: specific standard or a test method such as EN 16516? Why does the criteria refer to “0,06 mg of formaldehyde per m³ of material or component” when formaldehyde emission are expressed as air concentration?",
    "answer": "As regards point 1, the reference to REACH Annex XVII is appropriate, as it is under revision for formaldehyde and the revised version will include provisions regarding methods for testing emissions of formaldehyde. We expect that the new restriction of formaldehyde and formaldehyde releasing substances will be added to REACH Annex XVII and will be published in Q2 2023.\nAs regards point 2, the reference is meant to refer to m³ of chamber air in the test system.

    "question": "The DNSH criterion for pollution prevention and control of the activity “Construction of new buildings” in Section 7.1. requires that “Where the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site (brownfield site), the site has been subject to an investigation for potential contaminants, for example using standard ISO 18400”. If contamination is detected, should decontamination be implemented to comply with this criterion? Which thresholds should be considered to define if a site is contaminated? Is there any international reference or are national/local references to be used?",
    "answer": "The purpose of the criterion is to require, prior to the construction of a new building or a real estate project, the investigation of contaminants on a potentially contaminated site. This includes the investigation of sites where potentially contaminating risk activities took place, or sites where the presence of soil contamination is suspected (e.g. after an accident or calamity). The criterion requires that the investigation is aimed at collecting the necessary information for the confirmation of the presence of soil contamination and the determination of a risk assessment. Once the risk assessment is undertaken, the requirements of the criteria are met.\nA contaminated site is determined on a case-by-case basis after soil investigation and soil sampling (for instance, following the guidance of standard ISO 18400). Currently, there are no common EU thresholds to evaluate whether or not a site is contaminated. Most Member States have national legislation in place to tackle soil contamination, which in some cases include specific limit values and requirements for the investigation, sampling, risk assessment and remediation."

Or should incineration/waste be considered outside the 70%?",
    "answer": "The purpose of including the DNSH criterion to the objective on the transition to a circular economy is to require that 70% (by weight) of the non-hazardous construction and demolition waste generated on the construction site is prepared for reuse, recycling and other material recovery, including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other material.\nUnder Article 17(1)(d) of the Taxonomy Regulation, economic activities leading to a significant increase in the generation, incineration or disposal of waste, with the exception of the incineration of non-recyclable hazardous waste, should be considered to significantly harm the circular economy.\nOn this basis, the use of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste that would significantly increase incineration must be considered to harm the circular economy and does therefore not count towards the 70% threshold (by weight)."

The 30 % improvement results from an actual reduction in primary energy demand (where the reductions in net primary energy demand through renewable energy sources are not taken into account), and can be achieved through a succession of measures within a maximum of three years”\n.\nIt follows that the reductions in the primary energy demand are to be validated by an EPC, and should be estimated based on the methodology applicable, in line with the provisions of the Energy Performance for Buildings Directive. The directive clarifies that ‘primary energy’ means energy from renewable and non-renewable sources which has not undergone any conversion or transformation process.\nImproving the energy source to use renewable energy can qualify under Section 7.6. – “Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies”."

    "question": "Does the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class A in the substantial contribution criteria for activities related to the construction and real estate sector refer to primary energy demand or total energy demand?",
    "answer": "The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ‘class A’ that is required under the substantial contribution criteria of activity in Section 7.7. (“\nAcquisition and Ownership of buildings\n”) refers to the EPC class of the EPC scheme in the relevant Member State. The numerical indicator expressed in kWh/m2, mentioned in the EPC, is relevant and should be considered."

    "question": "What are the rules for defining the top 15% and top 30% benchmarks of the national market (with a distinction between residential and commercial) as referenced in the technical screening criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.? What should be done if there is no Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) nor any data to determine whether a building belongs to the best 15% of the national building stock?",
    "answer": "For determining Taxonomy-alignment, it should be demonstrated that a building is within the top 15% (or 30% for climate change adaptation) of the national or regional building stock, by adequate evidence. There are no specific rules for defining the top 15% or 30% of the building stock, beyond the requirements of referring to the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED), and distinguishing at least between residential and non-residential buildings.\nIn the absence of a relevant EPC, a technical study can be done to estimate the relevant threshold for the top 15% of the national (or regional) building stock for that category of building. There may be information available from national databases or studies produced by certain organisations (e.g. World Green Building Council).\nWhenever there is such a study publicly available, it can be used. When there is no study available, it has to be conducted. It can be expected that e.g. interested market actors or associations/institutes/public authorities could be willing to conduct or commission such studies and make them public, so that other entities (in particular smaller ones) could use them afterwards.\nThe EPC remains the simplest option, in the EU, as it can easily be obtained for most buildings, and it is also a mandatory when a building is sold.\nThe revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is considering how to address the availability of information on energy performance as well as databases on energy performance certificates."

  {
    "question": "What should be done if it is currently not possible to quantitatively name the top 15 % of the building stock before 31.12.2020, and there is no corresponding national evaluation of the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) already issued, and there is no valid data based on the operating energy demand of the existing building stock? As a first simplification, can calculated energy efficiency data (e.g. from energy performance certificates with standardised energy requirements for household electricity / operating electricity) be used as opposed to real consumption data (from buildings in operation) to determine Taxonomy-alignment with the substantial contribution criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.?",
    "answer": "In order to use the option of demonstrating that the building is within the top 15% of the national or regional building, adequate evidence should be provided (e.g. a recent study), which at least compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between residential and non-residential buildings. If such data is not available, a study can be conducted to perform such an assessment. Alternatively, the option of an EPC class A can be used.\nThere is no requirement to conduct the assessment based on real consumption data for demonstrating that a building is within the top 15% of the building stock. In fact, it is recommended to use estimated energy consumption, which better reflects the energy performance of the building (being less influenced by occupancy and behaviour patterns). Only for large non-residential buildings (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW), it is required to show that the building is also efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment."

    "answer": "The technical screening criteria require “\nadequate evidence, which at least compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between residential and non-residential buildings”\nif the option of the “\ntop 15% of the national or regional building stock”\nis used.

    "question": "The top 15% is a dynamic metric. Is grandfathering guaranteed for properties, e.g. over the entire term of a green bond, if they were among the top 15% at the time of issue?",
    "answer": "There is no grandfathering of the technical screening criteria themselves. If the criteria are revised and changed, or an activity falls out of compliance with criteria that are dynamic, a new assessment of (and where relevant effort to ensure) compliance is needed, as of the date when the criteria apply. This is distinct from the grandfathering of financial instruments or transactions on the basis of the criteria at the time of issuance or conclusion of a loan, where separate rules apply. (see for instance Article 7(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act which allows financial undertakings to report financed Taxonomy-aligned activities as such for up to five years after the application of revised criteria/changed coverage of criteria)."

  {
    "question": "What is the definition of operational Primary Energy Demand (PED)?",
    "answer": "The Annex I to the Delegated Act clarifies in footnote 281 that the Primary Energy Demand is ‘\nthe calculated amount of energy needed to meet the energy demand associated with the typical uses of a building expressed by a numeric indicator of total primary energy use in kWh/m\n2\nper year and based on the relevant national calculation methodology and as displayed on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).’\nThe Energy Performance of Buildings Directive defines in Article 2(5) primary energy as “\nenergy from renewable and non-renewable sources which has not undergone any conversion or transformation process”\n. It also explains in Annex I that “\nthe energy performance of a building shall be determined on the basis of calculated or actual energy use and shall reflect typical energy use for space heating, space cooling, domestic hot water, ventilation, built-in lighting and other technical building systems”\n."

  {
    "question": "The non-existing differentiation between residential and non-residential buildings in some Member States leads to the de facto inapplicability of these assessment categories for non-residential buildings, especially in the area of primary energy demand and the calculated CO2 emissions. Due to the higher electricity demand for non-residential buildings, the achievement of an A rating for primary energy demand and CO2 applies to very few buildings (even highly efficient non-residential buildings). What approach should be followed in such a situation?",
    "answer": "EU Member States have a certain flexibility in how to define the requirements for various types of buildings. In many cases the requirements are different for residential and non-residential buildings. For the purpose of the EU Taxonomy, the relevant criteria applicable to the relevant type of building should be complied with. In some Member States the criteria are strict and a very small share of buildings would qualify under the EPC class A. In such cases, the option of demonstrating that the building is within the top 15% of the national or regional building stock can be used."

    "question": "How should an energy management programme or system look like (e.g. according to ISO 50001 or EMAS)? Who is responsible – the tenant/user of the building or the landlord? What happens if tenants are changing or when the type of use changes within the property? Will there be concrete requirements regarding the documentation?",
    "answer": "The requirement is “\nWhere the building is a large non-residential building (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW) it is efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment”\n.

    "question": "What is the procedure if there is no national implementation of the requirements contained in Article 14(4) and Article 15(4) of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive as amended? Until national requirements are established, can an equivalent listing of the measures actually taken be used to determine alignment with the technical screening criteria of the activity “Acquisition and ownership of buildings” in Section 7.7.?",
    "answer": "The technical screening criteria require that large non-residential buildings (with an effective rated output for heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air-conditioning and ventilation of over 290 kW) are efficiently operated through energy performance monitoring and assessment. This can be demonstrated, for example, through the presence of an Energy Performance Contract or a building automation and control system in accordance with Article 14 (4) and Article 15 (4), of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. Therefore, a certain flexibility is allowed on how to demonstrate that a building is efficiently operated.\nWherever a national definition for building automation and control systems exists, it can be used. In case such a national definition does not exist, best practices should be used instead, and the elements included in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in relation to building automation and control systems can be used as a reference."

    "question": "Are heritage or protected buildings that are exempt from the Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) under national law, also exempt from demonstrating compliance with the EPC or Primary Energy demand requirements specified in Section 7.7 (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”)?",
    "answer": "Section 7.7 does not provide a derogation for buildings with heritage or protected status. Therefore, in order to qualify as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, all buildings that are built before 31 December 2020 must have at least an Energy Performance Certificate of Class A or be within the top 15% of the national or regional buildings stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand.\nHowever, entities have the option to explain in the narrative part of their reporting under Section 1.2.3. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act why certain assets are not Taxonomy-aligned, e.g. because they are heritage buildings."

    "question": "Does Section 7.7 (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”) differentiate the eligibility of the revenues derived from the ownership of the building (meeting technical screening criteria) depending on the type of economic activity being carried out? For example, in the case of airport buildings and terminals meeting the technical screening criteria under Section 7.7, can the revenues derived from the building ownership be covered regardless of their nature e.g. rents from duty-free shops or rents from ground handlers operations in the terminal?",
    "answer": "Activities detailed within the framework of Section 7.7 do not define the type of revenues derived from the building ownership that can be eligible or not. However, only revenues derived from the ownership of the building, e.g. rents, can be considered regardless of the activities that take place in a building (duty free shops, ground handlers operations). Other non-related revenues, e.g. revenues that are not derived from the ownership of the building, but directly from aeronautical activities carried out by the airport operator cannot be considered and are not covered by this activity. For instance, the rents for the occupation of the building paid by duty free-shops are eligible, but not the revenues generated by duty free shops from the sale of products to consumers."

    "question": "Are electronic communications networks (telecommunication) covered under the activities “Data processing, hosting and related activities” in Section 8.1. or “Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions” in Section 8.2 ?",
    "answer": "Electronic communications networks (telecommunication) as such are not included as an activity under the current coverage of the Taxonomy delegated act.\nSection 8.2 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act targets specific digital solutions that are developed with the predominant (main) purpose to reduce emissions. Such solutions can be an innovative combination of digital networks and technologies and applications such as 5G, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain.\nAn example of such a solution can be a precision farming solution, solutions for improving the energy efficiency of buildings or AI based solutions that reduce the energy consumption of 5G base stations. Consequently, solutions that significantly reduce emissions of the electronic communications services compared to best available alternative technologies are eligible under Section 8.2 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act.\nWhile the  generic public electronic communications network is an important and necessary infrastructure for the ICT solutions mentioned above, its predominant use or deployment is often not to reduce emissions. In cases where the electronic communications network is deployed and used in the context of the solution for GHG emissions reductions (for example, a specific machine-to-machine communication infrastructure to be used for precision farming) it is eligible under Section 8.2. Additions to a public electronic communication infrastructure required in the context of supporting the connectivity needs of the solution for GHG emissions reductions (such as network enhancement or support of network features required for the solution) are also eligible under Section 8.2."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between the technical screening criteria for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation set out in Annex II and the technical screening criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation set out in Annex I (climate change mitigation)?",
    "answer": "The DNSH criteria for climate change adaptation, which are included in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, cover a part of the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation, i.e. a risk and vulnerability assessment must be carried out to identify adaptation solutions.\nHowever, the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation as included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, add the requirement to\nimplement\nthe identified adaptation solutions. The criteria for their implementation are specified in point 4 of the substantial contribution criteria. Thus, as regards to the implementation of adaptation solutions that substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks, material to the activity under scrutiny, the substantial contribution criteria for adaptation (included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act) reflect a higher level of ambition than those for DNSH in\nAppendix A\nin Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act.\nSome economic activities cover only part of the value chain and have no impact on the part of the value chain that is predominantly threatened by climate change. How should this be addressed in the climate risk and vulnerability assessment?\nIt should be assured beyond reasonable doubt that the economic activity that is being targeted, cannot be affected by secondary or cascading impacts since major damage can often occur as a result of a succession of events (e.g. landslide after heavy rains). This can be done upfront or on the basis of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment.\nThe depth of the assessment may also vary, as long as it is sufficient to identify the physical climate risks that are material to the activity. For example, the extent to which risks may exist in the supply chain or in upstream production processes and whether these aspects need to be considered in the assessment can be weighed up individually for each activity. Decisive factors for the proportionality of the selected assessment approach can be the size of the company, the type, scale and context of the activity, the business model or the position in the supply chain.\nThe climate risk and vulnerability assessment needs to divide the economic activity (to the extent possible) into separate individual objects such as production sites, transport lines, adjacent administrative buildings, suppliers of critical material, their geographic location, etc.\nThe basis for a robust climate risk assessment is an understanding of how hazards can affect each individual object with regard to the activity under assessment. Some impacts of hazards are obvious, such as direct damage to production sites from flooding or storm events. However, not all climate impacts occur in a direct manner, but rather in succession with the potential of secondary impacts in a chain (so-called cascading effects). For example, storm events can damage the site of a critical supplier or energy infrastructure and cause power outages. Furthermore, risks can reinforce each other. Some risks even arise only through the combined effect of several climate hazards: some risks are exacerbated by successive hazards; for example, the risk of flooding is intensified when heavy rainfall hits dried-out soils."

    "answer": "Progress is being made in the asset-level modelling through the European Horizon Europe research programme and in the development of specific regional high-resolution projections. In all likelihood, the higher the demand for the high-resolution climate scenarios, the faster the supply will adjust.  For the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP2,6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, regional climate models with approx. 12.5*12.5 km² resolution are available on the European level. For some countries, there are further regionalized data with 5*5 km² resolution."

    "question": "Is it required to use all 4 IPCC pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5)? Do the outcomes of each analysis have to be assessed separately?",
    "answer": "No, it is not required to use all 4 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways.\nTo start the assessment, it is important to see whether the activity that is subject to the climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been subject to impacts from some hazards in the past (e.g. sea-level rise). If this is not the case, following line with the precautionary principle, RCP 8.5 (i.e. low mitigation) should be always used. If positive, lower end scenarios, e.g. RCP 4.5 could be used.\nThe outcomes of each analysis should be assessed separately."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a company proceed if not all of the four main scenarios of the IPCC are available?",
    "answer": "In principle, the available IPCC models should be used at a scale that is meaningful and proportionate for assessing potential impacts from hazards within the timeframe of the economic activity (above 10 years).\nThe undertaking should make sure it has access to the climate data relevant for the climate risk assessment. This data is normally available on CORDEX. Regionalised climate data with the highest possible resolution should be requested from the national meteorological services. The European Environment Agency (EEA) provides an interactive report with climate data (based on CMIP5 and EURO-CORDEX) aggregated at the level of subnational administrative regions and already assigned to climate hazards. In addition, climate data for individual scenarios can be retrieved from the European Climate Data Explorer.\nRegarding the choice of adequate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) to be taken into consideration, according to the\nTechnical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027\n(60)\nCommission Notice — Technical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027 (OJ JOC_2021_373_R_000).\n, RCP 4.5 may be used for climate projections up to 2060 as until that year there are only small differences between the scenarios. However, for subsequent years, RCP 4.5 may begin to underestimate the changes, in particular, if GHG emissions prove higher than anticipated. Hence, it could be more relevant to use RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 for current projections until 2100. Warming under RCP 8.5 is widely considered to be greater than current business-as-usual scenarios, but it has relevance from the perspective of risk management since tipping points could not be fully accounted for in IPCC projections, while climate change impacts have already been more pronounced than expected."

  {
    "question": "How does proportionality influence the scope of the robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment that has to be conducted as part of the DNSH climate change adaptation criteria?",
    "answer": "The objective of the robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is to identify significant physical climate risks to the performance of the economic activity. This assessment then forms the basis for the identification of suitable adaptation measures that are presented as part of an adaptation plan.\nAccording to the Climate Delegated Act, Annex 1,\nAppendix A\n, the climate risk and vulnerability assessment carried out should follow state-of-the-art methodology and take into account the most recent highest-resolution data available. The scope of the assessment, methods and data used to achieve this objective may vary to maintain proportionality. For example, in many cases it may be enough to use a pessimistic scenario, such as RCP 8.5, and not consider all four RCP scenarios, provided that the consideration of additional scenarios is unlikely to yield new insights relevant for the risk assessment.\nThe depth of the assessment may also vary, as long as it is sufficient to identify the physical climate risks that are material to the activity. For example, the extent to which risks may exist in the supply chain or in upstream production processes and whether these aspects need to be considered in the assessment can be weighed up individually for each activity. Decisive factors for the proportionality of the selected assessment approach can be the size of the company, the type, scale and context of the activity, the business model or the position in the supply chain. For example, replacing windows in an office building to improve energy efficiency requires a less detailed climate risk assessment than building a dam to generate hydropower.\nThe frequency of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment should also be proportionate to its objectives. Appropriate occasions for updates of the assessment and the resulting adaptation plan are changes that increase the exposure to the identified risks or that may pose new risks or significantly alter already identified risks to the performance of the economic activity, such as changes in:\nthe assessed economic activity, e.g. new suppliers or new production facilities;\nthe climate data basis of the assessment, e.g. unforeseen changes in climatic systems, changes in assumptions for climate models, or technological advances in climate modelling."

    "question": "What documentation must be provided to meet DNSH requirements related to climate change adaptation?",
    "answer": "To meet the requirements for DNSH to climate change adaptation for an economic activity for the purpose of the EU Taxonomy, it is essential to present a coherent adaptation plan if climate risks have been identified. The measures included in the plan should have been systematically assessed for their suitability to reduce the most important physical climate risks for the activity while meeting additional requirements outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. The adaptation plan should also include a timetable for implementing the measures and a documentation of measures already implemented.

    "question": "Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are not always required by national law. If the EIA is not required by EU law, is waiving the EIA then harmless for the assessment of Taxonomy-alignment?",
    "answer": "Not all activities are subject to a mandatory EIA in accordance with EU law. Nevertheless, for an economic activity to align with a DNSH criteria that requires compliance with\nAppendix D\n, the activity has to fulfil both of the following conditions:\nAn Environmental Impact Assessment or screening has been completed and the required mitigation and compensation measures implemented and;\nAn appropriate assessment within the meaning of Art. 6(3) of the Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC has been conducted, where applicable, for sites/operations located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas, and the mitigation measures implemented.\nTherefore, there is no need for an EIA in every case. The requirement in the criteria is to go through the process to determine whether there is need for an EIA – “\nAn Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or screening has been completed in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU\n”. If the screening has been done and the conclusion is that no EIA is needed, this part of the requirement is met.\nAs regards the approach outside of the EU, this is spelled out in footnote 334 of\nAppendix D\n: “\nFor activities in third countries, in accordance with equivalent applicable national law or international standards requiring the completion of an EIA or screening, for example, IFC Performance Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks.”"

    "question": "What are the minimum requirements of the Environmental Impact Assessment to achieve Taxonomy-alignment?",
    "answer": "The formal procedure to undertake an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is laid out by Directive 2011/92/EC. In practice, the EIA procedure can be summarised as follows:\nThe developer of a project may request the competent authority to declare what should be included in the EIA report to be provided (scoping stage);\nThe developer must provide the EIA report including information, in accordance with Art. 5(1) and Annex IV of the Directive;\nThe environmental authorities, local and regional authorities and the public (as well as affected Member states) must be informed and consulted;\nThe competent authority decides whether or not to authorize the project, taking into consideration the results of consultation;\nThe public is informed of the decision and can challenge the decision before the appropriate courts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does “for sites/operations located in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas” mean in practice?",
    "answer": "This applies either to activities that would take place within such areas, or activities that are likely to have a significant impact on such areas (hence the “\nor near\n”). It was not considered feasible to define a kilometre radius for “\nor near\n”, as this will vary from site to site (e.g. a dam on a river many kilometres downstream could affect the migration of protected fish species such as salmon in a Natura 2000 area upstream). In other words, where there is a likelihood of a significant risk to such area or site (i.e. that would hamper the conservation objectives for the site) from a development within or outside the site, this needs to be assessed by way of an appropriate assessment, prior to any development consent. In the EU, this is in line with EU Bird and Habitats Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC. The approach for countries outside of the EU is spelled out in footnote 335 of\nAppendix D\n."

    "question": "Some DNSH criteria seem to be company strategies or plans, rather than activity specific criteria. Is it enough to comply on company level or does it need to be broken down per activity or product level?",

    "question": "The Taxonomy criteria referring to the appropriate assessment according with Directive 2009/147/EC and Directive 92/43/EEC for UNESCO World Heritage sites and Key Biodiversity Areas, as well as other protected areas, are complex to implement in absence of the conservation objectives. How can an appropriate assessment be undertaken in the sites and protected areas mentioned in absence of conservation objectives?",
    "answer": "Site-specific Conservation objectives are required for sites designated under the Habitats Directive (as soon as designated as “Special Area of Conservation” - SAC) and the Birds Directive (“Special Protection Area” - SPA).\n(63)\nSee:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/management/docs/commission_note/commission_note2_EN.pdf\nAny appropriate assessment under Article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive should be carried out in light of those objectives.\n(64)\nSee:\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/management/pdf/methodological-guidance_2021-10/EN.pdf\nIn the case of a project requiring an appropriate assessment because it is likely to have a significant impact on a site (SAC or SPA) for which there are no conservation objectives yet (whereas the 6-year deadline for the designation as SAC has passed), the setting of conservation objectives should be a precondition, before the appropriate assessment. A project requiring such an assessment would not be compliant with the DNSH criteria for biodiversity if there would not be site-specific conservation objectives for the concerned site."

If compensation measures are defined, can a project be considered sustainable according to the criteria of the Climate Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "In Natura 2000 sites, compensation measures are required for projects that will adversely affect the integrity of a site (Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive). Such projects do not fulfil the criteria for DNSH to biodiversity and are therefore not Taxonomy-aligned."

    "question": "As regards the top 15% criterion concerning substantial contribution to CCM listed in Section 7.7. of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, would a conclusion that buildings built after a certain year are in the top 15% constitute an estimate which could only be used for voluntary reporting by credit institutions?",
    "answer": "The TSC listed in point 1 of Section 7.7 of Annex I to the Climated Delegated Act require ‘adequate evidence, which at least compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least EN EN distinguishes between residential and non-residential buildings’ if the option of the ‘top 15 % of the national or regional building stock’ is used.\nIn this respect, the reply to question 149 of the Commission Notice on the Climate Delegated Act specifies that:\n“There are no specific rules for defining the top 15 % or 30 % of the building stock, beyond the requirements of referring to the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED), and distinguishing at least between residential and non-residential buildings.\nIn the absence of a relevant EPC, a technical study can be done to estimate the relevant threshold for the top 15 % of the national (or regional) building stock for that category of building. There may be information available from national databases or studies produced by certain organisations (e.g. World Green Building Council).\nWhenever there is such a study publicly available, it can be used. When there is no study available, it has to be conducted.”\nThe response to question 151 in the Commission Notice on the Climate Delegated Act as regards the use of information on the construction year of buildings and building regulations states that, “it is not possible to use proxies, such as the year of the construction of the building.”\nTherefore, the use of the year of construction of a building constitutes an estimate for assessing compliance with the TSC that may be used only for voluntary reporting. Estimates of Taxonomy-alignment may be disclosed on a voluntary basis separately from the mandatory KPIs together with the methodology used to calculate such estimates."

  {
    "question": "What is the rationale for the Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "The goal of the EU Taxonomy is to prevent greenwashing and to help investors identify economic activities in line with our environmental and climate objectives.\nShifting towards renewable energy is essential for achieving climate neutrality. But it is also necessary to have stable sources to accelerate the transition towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe\nTaxonomy Regulation\nlays out three types of activities: low-carbon (Article 10(1)), transitional (Article 10(2)) and enabling (Article 16).\nIn this Complementary Climate Delegated Act, the Commission includes certain nuclear and gas activities in the second category of activities, i.e. transitional, those covered by Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. These are activities that cannot yet be replaced by technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, but do contribute to climate change mitigation and with the potential to play a major role in the transition to a climate-neutral economy, in line with EU climate goals and commitments, and subject to strict conditions, without crowding out investment in renewables.\nFurthermore, this Delegated Act also provides for specific disclosure requirements associated with natural gas and nuclear energy activities included in the act, by amending the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. This amendment will introduce requirements for large listed non-financial and financial companies to disclose the proportion of their activities linked to natural gas and nuclear energy. This should help investors to distinguish between the different activities they are investing in."
  },
  {
    "question": "How ambitious are the technical screening criteria, and do the included activities really lead to environmental benefits, e.g. as compared to energy production from coal?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act includes strict requirements for the activities to qualify. In the case of fossil gas-related activities, for example, the facility should switch fully to renewable or low-carbon gases by 31 December 2035. This can help accelerate the transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon gases.\nNuclear power is low-carbon. Expert advice sought by the Commission as part of its preparatory work (the reports of the Technical Expert Group until 2020, and the report of the Joint Research Committee in 2021) confirms this.\nFollowing scientific advice, the Commission has concluded that nuclear energy, subject to strict safety and environmental conditions (including on waste disposal) that ensure the respect of the do no significant harm principle, can play a role in the transition towards climate neutrality in line with the European Green Deal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rationale for defining nuclear activities as being in line with the EU's climate and environmental objectives?",
    "answer": "The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, advising the Commission on Taxonomy, acknowledged that nuclear represents a low-carbon energy source. This is in line with the positions of international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which consider CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants over their life-cycle comparable to those from renewable energy sources (as low or even lower).\nHowever, expert opinion has been less conclusive on the other environmental impacts of nuclear power and its compatibility with the “do no significant harm (DNSH)” criterion. For this reason, the Commission set up a specific process on nuclear energy, involving a technical assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people.\nFor nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place."
  },
  {
    "question": "What about considerations on nuclear waste?",
    "answer": "The\nTaxonomy Regulation\nrequires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment.\nNuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste.\nThe EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum.\nIn addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries."

    "question": "What is the rationale for defining certain gas-related activities as “substantially contributing to” the EU climate and environmental objectives?",
    "answer": "During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act.\nThe European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently,\nthe Fit for 55 Package\n). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply.\nThe EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the\nClimate Target Plan\nand the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition."

  {
    "question": "Unlike nuclear power, natural gas undoubtedly releases CO2 when it is converted into electricity or heat. How can this form of energy lead to environmental benefits?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels – a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated.\nThe technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035."
  },
  {
    "question": "What activities and accompanying criteria does the Complementary Climate Delegated Act introduce?",
    "answer": "Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act:\nintroduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy.\nThe Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy.\nintroduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors.\nThose requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency.\nMore specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities:\nNuclear-related activities\n:\nAdvanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (“Generation IV”) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);\nNew nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (“Generation III+”), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);\nModifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority)\nGas-related\nactivities\n:\nEach gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds:\nlifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, or\nuntil 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out."

  {
    "question": "What are the amendments introduced to the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation?",
    "answer": "In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors.\nIn addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors."

    "question": "Which key performance indicators (KPIs) should undertakings such as central counterparties (CCPs), central securities depositories (CSDs), leasing companies and payment institutions report? Should exposures to those entities be treated as exposures to financial or non-financial undertakings?",
    "answer": "Where undertakings are subject to sustainability reporting as referred to in Articles 19a and 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\n, those undertakings need to assess which KPIs are applicable to them.\nUndertakings that meet the definition of financial undertakings in accordance with Article 1(8) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(i.e. asset managers, credit institutions, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings) should report the specific KPIs as provided in the Disclosures Delegated Act (DDA). Undertakings that do not meet the definition of financial undertakings in accordance with Article 1(8) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, but which provide financial services, should be considered to be non-financial undertakings. They should report the KPIs of non-financial undertakings in accordance with Annexes I and II DDA.\nNevertheless, in addition to disclosing the mandatory KPIs for non-financial undertakings, such undertakings are encouraged to voluntarily disclose the KPIs for financial undertakings given that those KPIs could be a more relevant indicator of the Taxonomy-alignment of financial services that they provide.\nWhere the reporting undertaking provides functionally the same activities as a specific financial undertaking defined in Article 1(8) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, it may also voluntarily apply the KPIs pertaining to that financial undertaking. For instance, a reporting undertaking that provides banking services such as loans and financing may apply on a voluntary basis the provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act relevant for credit institutions for the purpose of Taxonomy disclosures.\nAlso, where Member State law requires CCPs, CSDs, leasing companies or payment institutions to carry out their specific activities an authorisation pertaining to a financial undertaking, those undertakings are encouraged to apply the KPIs applicable to that category of financial undertaking. For example, where an authorisation is required by a Member State under Article 8 of the\nCapital Requirements Directive\n(CRD) to perform those activities, the undertaking may voluntarily apply the KPIs applicable to credit institutions (Annexes V and VI DDA).\nFurther explanations on how the KPIs for financial undertakings could be applied by entities providing financial services are provided in Annex I to the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2)."

    "question": "Should financial undertakings calculate two key performance indicators (KPIs) for investments or exposures, one based on the turnover KPIs and one based on CapEx KPIs of investee companies or counterparties? Or should financial undertakings combine the values from the turnover and CapEx KPIs of investee companies or counterparties into a single KPI?",
    "answer": "The\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) specifies the methodology for the assessment in the KPIs of exposures where the use of proceeds is known or unknown.\nArticle 7(4), subparagraph 2, of the Disclosures Delegated Act provides that exposures to financial instruments whose purpose is not to finance specific identified activities (unknown use of proceeds) should be included in the numerator of the relevant KPI weighted by the turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of the issuer, in accordance with the methodology laid down in Annexes III, V, VII, and IX DDA. For certain KPIs of credit institutions and investment firms, the methodology stipulates the use of KPI of the counterparty instead of the KPI of the issuer. In addition, in accordance with paragraph (4) of Section 1.2.1. of Annex V DDA, exposures that are loans and advances, debt securities, equities and reposesed collateral financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities should be included in the numerator of the relevant KPI based on turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of underlying assets.\nFinancial undertakings should therefore compute and disclose two separate sets of KPIs:\na turnover-based KPI where the weighting of exposures with unknown use of proceeds is based on the turnover KPIs of the relevant issuers/counterparties; and\na CapEx-based KPI where the weighting of exposures with unknown use of proceeds is based on the CapEx KPIs of the relevant issuers/counterparties.\nExposures that have the purpose of financing specific identified activities (known use of proceeds) should enter the numerators of both separate sets of KPIs of the financial undertaking, turnover-based and CapEx based, respectively, to the extent those exposures finance Taxonomy-aligned activities, without further weighting by the KPI of the issuer/counterparty.\n1\nTherefore, for the calculation of the numerator of their KPIs financial undertakings should include exposures as follows:\nthe numerator of turnover-based KPIs should equal (i) the amount of exposures with known use of proceeds financing Taxonomy-aligned activities plus (ii) the amount of exposures with unknown use of proceeds weighted with the turnover KPIs of the relevant issuers/counterparties;\nthe numerator of CapEx-based KPIs should equal (i) the amount of exposures with known use of proceeds financing Taxonomy-aligned activities plus (ii) the amount of exposures with unknown use of proceeds weighted by the CapEx KPIs of the relevant issuers/counterparties.\nMore information per type of financial undertaking is provided below.\nAsset managers\nIn accordance with the last subparagraph of section 1.2. of Annex III DDA, asset managers should disclose two separate KPIs based on the turnover and CapEx KPIs of investee companies. The calculations for these turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs are specified per type of investee company in Section 1.1. of Annex III DDA, points (a) to (e).\nThis is reflected accordingly in the reporting template set out in Annex IV DDA, which requires reporting undertakings to complete KPI values based separately on the turnover and CapEx KPIs of investee companies (i.e. in the first row as well as in the sections “Additional complementary disclosures: breakdown of numerator of the KPI” and “Breakdown of the numerator of the KPI per environmental objective”).\nInsurance and reinsurance undertakings\nIn accordance with points (a) to (e) of the fifth paragraph of Section 1 of Annex IX DDA, insurance and reinsurance undertakings should disclose the KPI related to investments separately based on the turnover and CapEx KPIs of their investee companies. The calculations for the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of investee companies are specified in those points per type of investee company.\nThis is reflected accordingly in the first row of the reporting template set out in Annex X DDA, which requires reporting undertakings to complete of KPI values based separately on turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs (i.e. in the first row as well as in the sections “Additional complementary disclosures: breakdown of numerator of the KPI” and “Breakdown of the numerator of the KPI per environmental objective”).\nInvestment firms\nIn accordance with section 2.4. of Annex VII DDA, investment firms should compute the GAR for their services and activities dealing on own account by relying on the turnover KPI and CapEx KPI of investee undertakings for each environmental objective.\nThe calculations for the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of investee companies are specified per type of investee company in Annex VII DDA, section 2.4., third paragraph, points (a) to (e). The KPIs for investment firms’ activities other than dealing on own accounts should be calculated mutatis mutandis using turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of counterparties of their clients (see Annex VII DDA, section 3.3.).\nThis is reflected accordingly in the disclosure templates for KPIs of investment firms. KPI values based on the turnover and CapEx KPIs of the counterparty should be disclosed, respectively, in the fourth and fifth columns of template 0 (\nSummary of KPIs\n) of Annex VIII DDA. In addition, investment firms should duplicate template 1 (\nKPI IF – Dealing on own account services\n) and template 2 (\nKPI IF Other services\n) for turnover-based and CapEx-based disclosures.\nCredit institutions\nFor credit institutions, details of the calculations for the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of underlying assets are set out in Annex V DDA for each component of the relevant KPI. For instance, with respect to the GAR for on-balance sheet exposures, Annex V DDA, Section 1.2.1., fourth paragraph, point (a), provides that the numerator of the KPI should cover the loans and advances, debt securities, equities and repossessed collaterals financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities based on the turnover and CapEx KPIs of the underlying assets.\nThis is reflected accordingly in the disclosure templates for KPIs of credit institutions. KPI values based on turnover and CapEx KPIs of the counterparty should be disclosed, respectively, in the fourth and fifth columns of template 0 (\nSummary of KPIs\n) of Annex VI DDA. In addition, credit institutions should duplicate templates 3 (\nGAR KPI stock\n), 4 (\nGAR KPI flow\n), 5 (\nKPI off-balance sheet exposures\n), 6 (\nKPI on fees and commissions income from services other than lending and asset management\n) and 7 (\nKPI Trading book portfolio\n) for turnover-based and CapEx-based disclosures, as clarified in the footnotes to the relevant template.\n1\nFor example, an exposure with known use of proceeds financing a Taxonomy-aligned activity of 100 million EUR should be included in both the numerator of the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPI - in the same amount - without weighting the KPI of the respective issuer/counterparty."

    "question": "What key performance indicator (KPI) should a financial undertaking use to assess its exposure to another financial undertaking that reports one or more KPIs? When computing exposures to an insurance or reinsurance undertaking, how should a financial undertaking combine investment and underwriting KPIs for the purpose of assessing that exposure?",
    "answer": "As specified in question 3 of the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2), financial undertakings should compute their turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs using, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the respective issuers/counterparties to assess the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures\n1\nto them. This also applies if they are other financial undertakings, as further specified below.\nExposures to asset managers\nIn accordance with the respective provisions of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA)\n2\n, where reporting financial undertakings have exposures to an asset manager, those financial undertakings should use, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the counterparty asset manager to assess the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures to that counterparty asset manager.\nSimilarly, where the financial undertakings invest in or lend to an undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or alternative investment fund (AIF), the reporting financial undertakings should use, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the asset manager that manages that UCITS or AIF to compute their own KPIs.\nExposures to credit institutions\nIn accordance with the respective provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act\n3\n, where reporting financial undertakings have exposures to a credit institution, those financial undertakings should use, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based green asset ratio (GAR) of the counterparty credit institution (i.e. the Total GAR of the counterparty) to assess the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures to that counterparty credit institution.\nReporting financial undertakings should use a weighted average of the respective counterparty credit institution’s applicable turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs, where financial undertakings have exposures to that counterparty credit institution whose total GAR (i.e. total GAR on loan/debt/equity instruments in the banking book) is not applicable because:\nthe business model of that counterparty credit institution does not cover the activities that create loan/debt/equity exposures in a banking book (e.g. investment banking), or\nthe total GAR of that counterparty credit institution is not material in the business model of that counterparty.\nTo comply with the the last indent of Annex XI DDA, the counterparty credit institution should compute and disclose in the accompanying contextual information both a turnover-based and CapEx-based weighted average of the applicable KPIs with the weightings in accordance with the proportion of the revenue derived from the activities covered by the corresponding KPIs in its total turnover.\nFor example, a counterparty credit institution active in investment banking could derive:\n50% of its total revenue from activities referred to in Section 1.2.3. of Annex V (KPIs on services other than lending – Fees and Commissions (F&C KPI));\n30% of its total revenue from activities referred to in Section 1.2.4. of Annex V (GAR for the trading portfolio); and\n20% of its total revenue from activities referred to in Section 1.2.2.2. of Annex V (Green ratio for assets under management (AuM KPI)).\nTo assess their exposures to such a counterparty credit institution, reporting financial undertakings should use the turnover-based and CapEx-based weighted average of the applicable KPIs of the counterparty credit institution that the counterparty credit institution should compute as follows:\nTurnover-based weighted average of applicable KPIs = its Fees and Commissions KPI (turnover-based) multiplied by 50% + its GAR for trading portfolio (turnover-based) multiplied by 30% + its AuM KPI (turnover-based) multiplied with 20%;\nCapEx-based weighted average of applicable KPIs = its Fees and Commissions KPI (CapEx-based) multiplied by 50% + its GAR for trading portfolio (CapEx-based) multiplied with 30% + its AuM KPI (CapEx-based) multiplied by 20%.\nExposures to investment firms\nIn accordance with the relevant provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act\n4\n, where reporting financial undertakings have exposures to an investment firm, those financial undertakings should use, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the counterparty investment firm to assess the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures to that counterparty investment firm. The investment firm should publish in the accompanying contextual disclosures, referred to in the last indent of Annex XI DDA, the turnover-based KPI and a CapEx based KPI that should be computed as follows:\nthe turnover-based KPI of the investment firm should be computed as a weighted average of the turnover-based KPI of the investment firm on activities of dealing on own account and turnover-based KPI of the investment firm on activities other than dealing on own account with weightings in accordance with the proportion of revenue from activities dealing on own account and the proportion of revenue from activities other than dealing on own account in the total revenue (income) of the investment firm;\nthe CapEx-based KPI of the investment firm should be computed as a weighted average of the CapEx-based KPI of the investment firm on activities of dealing on own account and CapEx-based KPI of the investment firm on activities other than dealing on own account with weightings in accordance with the proportion of revenue from activities dealing on own account and the proportion of revenue from activities other than dealing on own account in the total revenue (income) of the investment firm.\nExposures to insurance and reinsurance undertakings\nIn accordance with the relevant provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act\n5\n, where reporting financial undertakings have exposures to an insurance or a reinsurance undertaking pursuing only activities of life-insurance or reinsurance provisioning, to assess the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures to that insurance or reinsurance undertaking the reporting financial undertakings should use, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPI on investments of the counterparty insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\nWhere financial undertakings have exposures to an insurance or a reinsurance undertaking pursuing activities of non-life insurance provisioning (or providing both life and non-life services), the reporting financial undertakings should use, respectively, the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the counterparty insurance or reinsurance undertaking to assess the Taxonomy-alignement of their exposures to that counterparty insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\nTo comply with the the last indent of Annex XI DDA, the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should disclose in its contextual information, a turnover-based KPI and CapEx-based KPI that should be computed as follows:\nthe turnover-based KPI of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should be computed as the weighted average of the turnover-based KPI on investments of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and the KPI on non-life underwriting of the insurance or reinsurance underwriting with weightings in accordance with the proportion of revenue that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking derives from its investing activities and the proportion of revenue the insurance or reinsurance undertaking derives from its non-life underwriting activities in the total revenue of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking;\nthe CapEx-based KPI of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking should be computed as weighted average of the CapEx-based KPI on investments of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking and of the KPI on non-life underwriting of the insurance or reinsurance underwriting with weightings in accordance with the proportion of revenue that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking derives from its investing activities and the proportion of revenue that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking derives from its non-life underwriting activities in the total revenue of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking.\n1\nWhere the use of proceeds is unknown.\n2\npoint (b) of Section 1.1. of Annex III DDA for asset managers; seventh paragraph of Section 1.2.1.2 of Annex V DDA for credit institutions; point (b) in Section 2.4 of Annex VII DDA for investment firms; for financial undertakings that point (b) of fifth paragraph of Section 1 of Annex IX DDA for insurance or reinsurance undertakings.\n3\npoint (c) of Section 1.1. of Annex III DDA for asset managers; fifth paragraph of Section 1.2.1.2 of Annex V DDA for credit institutions; point (c) in Section 2.4 of Annex VII DDA for investment firms; point (c) of fifth paragraph of Section 1 of Annex IX DDA for insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n4\npoint (d) of Section 1.1. of Annex III DDA for asset managers; sixth paragraph of Section 1.2.1.2 of Annex V DDA for credit institutions; point (d) in Section 2.4 of Annex VII DDA for investment firms; point (d) of fifth paragraph of Section 1 of Annex IX DDA for insurance and reinsurance undertakings.\n5\npoint (e) of Section 1.1. of Annex III DDA for asset managers; eighth paragraph of Section 1.2.1.2 of Annex V DDA for credit institutions; point (e) in Section 2.4 of Annex VII DDA for investment firms; point (e) of fifth paragraph of Section 1 of Annex IX DDA for insurance or reinsurance undertakings."

    "question": "What should financial undertakings report if counterparty entities’ key performance indicators (KPIs) are not publicly available or are inaccurate? For instance, how should financial undertakings report in their KPIs disclosed in 2024 their exposures to other counterparty financial undertakings, which will need to report their respective KPIs only as of 2024?",
    "answer": "In accordance with Article 8(4) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA), financial undertakings must use the most recently available information and KPIs of their counterparties for their Taxonomy-alignment reporting. There may be circumstances where KPIs of underlying entities or counterparties are not readily or publicly available. For example, where KPIs of reporting financial undertakings are calculated based on exposures to other financial undertakings, those reporting financial undertakings may not have all the information publicly available to enable them to make their own Taxonomy-alignment disclosures in the first reporting cycle (in 2024).\nWhere the most recent KPIs of counterparties that are required to report Taxonomy KPIs as part of their sustainability reporting under Articles 19a and 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\nare not publicly or readily available, financial undertakings that rely on those KPIs for their own reporting are encouraged to contact those counterparties. Any exchanges of information should comply with the Union competition rules.\nIf financial undertakings are nonetheless unable to obtain relevant KPIs from the counterparty in question or these remain unfit for the purpose of calculating their own KPIs, financial undertakings should use the most recently available KPIs disclosed in the previous year(s). Where such KPIs from previous years are also unavailable\n1\n, the exposure should be considered as non-eligible or not aligned, i.e. financial undertakings should enter a ‘zero’ value in the numerator of the relevant KPI without any further assessment. Such disclosure should be accompanied by contextual information as part of the financial undertaking’s qualitative disclosures (which includes information on data sources and limitation) in accordance with Annex XI DDA. In addition to reporting a ‘zero’ value in this case as part of their mandatory disclosures, reporting financial undertakings could choose to estimate their Taxonomy-alignment and report that information voluntarily, separately from their mandatory disclosures\n2\n.\n1\nFor instance, the KPIs of financial counterparty undertakings are not yet available for the first reporting cycle of financial undertakings in 2024, for which only the ratio of Taxonomy-eligibility, but not of Taxonomy-alignment is available as disclosed in the 2022 and in the 2023 reporting cycles by those counterparty undertakings.\n2\nVoluntary reporting should not contradict or misrepresent mandatory information under the Disclosures Delegated Act. It should also not be more prominent than mandatory disclosures. If an undertaking includes voluntary reporting, it should add supporting detail to it setting out the basis for this disclosure, the methods used for its preparation, and a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting."

    "question": "How should financial undertakings treat restatements of key performance indicators (KPIs) (i.e. corrections of KPIs already published) by their counterparties? Do financial undertakings have to recalculate and restate their KPIs from the previous year whenever their counterparties restate their respective KPIs from the previous year?",
    "answer": "The\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) requires financial undertakings to use the KPIs disclosed by their counterparties when they calculate their own KPIs, notably the green asset ratio (GAR). Non-financial undertakings are required to explain why changes in calculations of their KPIs since the previous reporting period result in more reliable and relevant information and provide for restated comparative figures (cf. Section 1.2.1. of Annex I DDA).\nIn accordance with Article 8(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, financial undertakings must use the most recently available information provided by their counterparties for their alignment reporting. Where, for instance, counterparty non-financial undertakings are required to restate prior year information or KPIs in accordance with Section 1.2.1. of Annex I DDA, the latest available data for the reporting financial undertakings would need to include those restated figures or KPIs.\nReporting financial undertakings would need to restate their own KPIs only to the extent the restated figures or KPIs from the counterparty undertakings have a material impact on the calculation of the reporting financial undertakings’ KPIs. Reporting financial undertakings should therefore assess on a case-by-case basis whether the restated figures or KPIs from counterparty undertakings have such a material impact on their own KPI(s), and provide for restated comparative figures and KPIs accordingly."

The parent undertakings must also indicate which subsidiaries included in the consolidation are exempted from annual or consolidated sustainability reporting pursuant to paragraph (9) of Article 19a or paragraph (8) of Article 29a respectively.\nIn such situations, the consolidated sustainability reporting should also provide subsidiary level Taxonomy KPIs in the contextual information (emphasis added)\n.\n”\nFor assessing the exposures from financial instruments and lending where the use of proceeds is unknown, financial undertakings should ensure that they use the KPIs providing the most relevant and representative view of their investee companies' actual activities.\nWhere a subsidiary has a parent or an ultimate parent undertaking that reports KPIs under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation (\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32020R0852\n) and the Disclosures Delegated Act, the exposure of a financial undertaking to that subsidiary should be included in the numerator of the relevant KPIs of that financial undertaking. Therefore, financial undertakings should use the KPI of the subsidiary disclosed by its parent or ultimate parent or, where the KPI of the subsidiary is not available, the KPIs of the closest reporting parent undertaking to assess the exposures of a financial undertaking to that subsidiary in accordance with the relevant Annex to the Disclosures Delegate Act.\nIn case of exposures to a subsidiary of a parent undertaking that falls under the scope of Article 19a of the Accounting Directive, but where that subsidiary is exempted from sustainability reporting at individual level on grounds that its parent does so on a consolidated basis in accordance with Article 19a(9) of the Accounting Directive, financial undertakings should use the KPI of the subsidiary disclosed by its parent in the contextual information.\nFor the assessment of exposures from instruments and lending where the use of proceeds is known, the reporting financial undertaking should assess the extent of the Taxonomy-alignment of the economic activities and assets financed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act."

    "question": "How should exposures to special purpose vehicles (‘SPVs’) be treated? Do financial undertakings have to assess specialised lending/project financing for the purpose of Taxonomy-alignment reporting?",
    "answer": "Disclosure obligations of financial undertakings under the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) are intended to provide information about the extent to which their investments or financing are funding Taxonomy-aligned activities. This means that, for the purpose of the disclosures required by the Disclosures Delegated Act, financial undertakings should look through their investments and assets to assess those investee undertakings that are the ultimate beneficiaries and their taxonomy-aligned activities.\nFinancial undertakings should include in their Taxonomy assessment exposures to SPVs that finance entities subject to Article 19a or 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\nor that belong to a group where the parent of the SPV is subject to Article 29a of that Directive on a consolidated group level\n1\n.\nThis implies that for lending and investments, where the use of proceeds is unknown, financial undertakings should use the KPIs of the undertaking that is the ultimate beneficiary of the financing that controls a SPV or, where those KPIs are not available, the KPIs of its reporting parent undertaking to assess their exposure to that SPV. For financing and investments where the use of proceeds is known, financial undertakings should take into account the Taxonomy-alignment of the economic activities financed through a SPV to assess their exposure to that SPV (see reply to question 3 of the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2)).\nFor the purpose of disclosures of the breakdowns of the numerator of their KPIs per type of issuer/counterparty, financial undertakings should include such exposures in the appropriate rows of their respective Taxonomy reporting templates. These should correspond to the type of entities whose KPIs the financial undertaking applies to that exposure, or whose assets are financed.\nIf the ultimate beneficiary is an undertaking that is not subject to Article 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive or if its ultimate parent undertaking is not subject to these Articles, exposures toward SPVs should be excluded from the numerator of the KPIs of financial undertakings in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act with the exception of bonds and debt securities exposures referred to in Article 7(4) of that Delegated Act. However, the Taxonomy-alignment of those exposures could be reported on a voluntary basis.\n1\nIf an SPV is financing several undertakings, the exposure towards the SPV should be included in the numerator of KPIs of financial undertakings if at least one financed undertaking consolidates the SPV and is subject to Article 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive."

    "question": "How should exposures of financial undertakings to regional governments and to entities controlled by States be treated?",
    "answer": "Article 7(1) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) only excludes exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers from the calculation of the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators (KPIs) of financial undertakings. The reference to central governments includes all administrative departments of the State and other central agencies whose competence extends normally over the whole economic territory of the given State. Consequently, exposures to regional governments, municipalities or undertakings whose owners or shareholders are those that are referred to in Article 7(1) of the Disclosures Delegated Act are not covered by that exclusion.\nTherefore, financial instruments or lending, where the use of proceeds is known, financing regional and local public authorities should be included in the numerator of the KPIs of financial undertakings to the extent that the instruments or lending are Taxonomy-aligned. All instruments or lending, where the use of proceeds is known, financing those authorities should be included in the denominator of the KPIs of financial undertakings. However, lending or financing where the use of proceeds is unknown should be excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the KPIs of financial undertakings."

    "question": "How should financial undertakings reflect in their key performance indicators (KPIs) exposures to EU and non-EU undertakings that are not subject to sustainability reporting in accordance with Articles 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive? \nDo bonds issued by undertakings not subject to sustainability reporting in accordance with Articles 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive have to be issued as European green bond (EuGB) to be included in the numerator of the GAR (Section 1.2.1.1., point (ii), of Annex V DDA)? \nHow should financial instruments (loans) where the use of proceeds is known financing those undertakings be assessed?",
    "answer": "In accordance with Article 7(3) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA), exposures to undertakings (including non-EU undertakings) which do not fall under Articles 19a and 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\nare excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator of the KPIs of financial undertakings. This treatment will be reviewed in accordance with Article 9 of the Disclosures Delegated Act.\nHowever, Article 7(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act states: “\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 1, environmentally sustainable bonds or debt securities with the purpose of financing specific identified activities that are issued by an investee undertaking shall be included in the numerator of KPIs up to the full value of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that the proceeds of those bonds and debt securities finance, on the basis of information provided by the investee undertaking.\n” Therefore, financial undertakings should include in the numerator of their KPIs the proceeds of environmentally sustainable bonds and debt securities whose purpose is to finance specific identified activities and assets regardless of whether or not the issuer is an undertaking subject to sustainability reporting in accordance with Articles 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive. Such environmentally sustainable bonds may be issued as\nEuGB\nor in accordance with public or private standards and initiatives.\nMoreover, the Disclosures Delegated Act does not prevent financial undertakings from including voluntary information or estimates as part of voluntary disclosures about the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures to entities that are currently excluded from the scope of the numerator of KPIs in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Such information must always be reported separately from mandatory disclosures under the Disclosures Delegated Act. In addition, for environmentally sustainable bonds and debt instruments, financial undertakings may use estimates for assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures to undertakings established in a third country that are not subject to sustainability reporting pursuant to Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive, under the conditions specified in Article 7(7) of the Disclosures Delegated Act."

    "question": "How can real estate leases be treated in the calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs)?",
    "answer": "Depending on the lease contract, accounting rules distinguish between finance lease and operating lease. Treatment of leasing in the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) follows the accounting rules of\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (\nIFRS) 16. In the context of finance lease, the lessee recognises the leased asset as a right-of-use asset at the commencement of the lease contract\n1\n. Correspondingly, Section 1.1.2.1. of Annex I DDA includes additions to right-of-use assets in the CapEx denominator of the lessee since they represent additions to tangible and intangible assets.\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, at the commencement date, a lessor should recognise assets held under a finance lease in its statement of financial position and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease, i.e. net present value of lease payments. Correspondingly, for the purpose of Taxonomy KPIs, financial undertakings providing finance leases should treat assets held under a finance lease as an exposure (loan & advance) where the use of proceeds is known, and include them in the denominator of their green asset ratio (GAR). They should include them in the numerator of their GAR to the extent the leased assets are Taxonomy-aligned (see also response to question 1 of this Notice)\n2\n.\nFor the purposes of their Taxonomy KPIs, parties to real estate leases should thus consider the way, in which they account for the asset in their financial statements. NACE code L68 quoted in Section 7.7. (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”) of the Climate Delegated Act also covers leased real estate.\n1\nLessee also recognises lease liability equal to the net present value of lease payments. During the course of the lease, lessee splits lease payments into reduction of the lease liability and interest expense on the lease liability. Interest expense on the lease liability and depreciation of leased asset are accounted for as costs by the lessee.\n2\nA lessor should recognise finance income over the lease term, based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease. A lessor aims to allocate finance income over the lease term on a systematic and rational basis. A lessor should apply the lease payments relating to the period against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance income."

    "question": "How should financial undertakings report investments in real estate assets which are not collateralised by residential property?",
    "answer": "The exposures of credit institutions to real estate assets which are collateralised by residential property are specified in Section 1.2.1.3. of Annex V to the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA). Loans pertaining to construction and real estate activities referred to in Section 7 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act with equivalent arrangements to collateralisation by residential property (e.g. mortgage), such as loans with third-party guarantees should also be included in this calculation. Beside this, financial undertakings should report the following real estate exposures:\nCredit institutions: repossessed real estate collaterals (Annex V DDA, Section 1.2.1.5.);\nAsset managers, investment firms, insurance and reinsurance undertakings: investments in real estate to the extent and in the proportion in which they finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (see in particular Annex III DDA, Section 1.1., fourth paragraph; Annex VII DDA, Section 2.4., sixth paragraph; Annex IX DDA, Section 1, seventh paragraph).\nThe values recorded in the numerator and denominator should follow the accounting classification of such investments."

    "question": "The criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in Section 7.1. (“Construction of new buildings”) and Section 7.7. (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”) of the Climate Delegated Act refers to the nearly zero emissions building (NZEB) criteria, which are defined at national level. When a Member State changes NZEB criteria, should financial undertakings reassess the Taxonomy-alignment of the buildings that they finance by taking into account the new NZEB criteria?",
    "answer": "Yes. The technical screening criteria (TSC) laid down in Sections 7.1. and 7.7. of Annex I to the\nClimate Delegated Act\nrefer to NZEB requirements, which are defined at national level. Therefore, the grandfathering treatment specified in Article 7(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act (DDA) for loans and instruments where the use of proceeds is known in cases where TSC are amended does not apply to the situation when a Member States changes the NZEB criteria in its jurisdiction. Hence, as of when changes to these NZEB criteria become applicable, exposures by financial undertakings to the relevant real estate assets should be reassessed for the purposes of claiming their Taxonomy-alignment (see also question 152 in the\nCommission Notice on the Climate Delegated Act\n)."

    "question": "For the purpose of assessing the Taxonomy-alignment under Section 7.7. (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”) of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, buildings built before 31 December 2020 must have at least an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) class A label or be “within the top 15% of the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED) and demonstrated by adequate evidence”. Similarly, the technical screening criteria (TSC) for activity under Section 7.2. (‘Renovation of existing buildings’) of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, provide for two TSC for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (CCM). Could these two criteria be used simultaneously for assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of the respective activities?",
    "answer": "Point (1) of Section 7.7 of Annex I to the\nClimate Delegated Act\npertaining to the TSC for substantial contribution to CCM provide for two TSC to assess Taxonomy-alignment for buildings built before 31 December 2020. Similarly, Section 7.2 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act pertaining to the TSC for substantial contribution to CCM provide for two TSC to assess Taxonomy-alignment for buildings renovation. Financial undertakings may choose to apply any of the two TSC, but they should not double count the same exposures in the numerator of the relevant KPIs where a building meets both TSC. For instance, for activity ‘Acquisition and ownership of buildings’ in section 7.7 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, this implies that:\nan exposure to a building without an EPC class A label can be counted in the numerator of the KPI on grounds that it meets the top 15% criterion, and\nan exposure to a building with an EPC class A label, cannot be counted twice in the numerator of the KPI on grounds that it also meets the top 15% criterion."

    "question": "For the purpose of assessing Taxonomy-alignment under Section 7.7. (“Acquisition and ownership of buildings”) of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, if a credit institution extrapolates the known national distribution of energy performance certificate (EPC) A-labels to its own mortgage portfolio in a geographic area, and does not use its own mortgage information but fully relies on external data sources with no further assurance on the external data, would this constitute an estimate that could only be used for voluntary reporting?",
    "answer": "An extrapolation of the EPC-composition of a mortgage portfolio based on national statistics alone would constitute an estimate for the purposes of assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of the mortgage portfolio that cannot be included in the KPIs of financial undertakings. For example, if national statistics show that a certain proportion of buildings built before 31 December 2020 have EPC class A, it does not imply that a mortgage portfolio automatically has the same proportion. However, estimates may be disclosed on a voluntary basis separately from the mandatory KPIs together with the methodology used to calculate such estimates."

    "answer": "Buildings with expired EPC class A label could still be assessed whether they meet the top 15% criterion listed in paragraph (1) of Section 7.7 of Annex I to the\nClimate Delegated Act\n, if substantiated with further “adequate evidence” as required by the TSC as further explained in the responses to questions 149 to151 of the\nCommission Notice on the Climate Delegated Act\n.\nAssuming that buildings with expired EPC class A labels are automatically in the top 15% performance bracket alone would not on its own suffice to ascertain their Taxonomy-alignment and their inclusion into the numerator of relevant KPIs.

In accordance with Section 1.2. of Annex III DDA, the denominator should consist of the value of all assets under management (AuM) without exposures referred to in Article 7(1) of the Disclosures Delegated Act resulting from both collective and individual portfolio management activities of asset managers. Hence, financial undertakings should include all AuM in the denominator of their KPIs, including all derivatives asset positions without offsetting with any derivative liabilities, unless permitted under IFRS (see also the response to question 25 of the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2))\n1\n.\n1\nSimilarly for short positions, the denominator therefore covers all assets under management without offsetting with short position liabilities, except where permitted under the\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (\nIFRS)."

    "question": "How should the Taxonomy-alignment of instruments such as securitisations, structured notes and covered bonds be reported and assessed? How does this approach interact with the requirements for European green bonds (EuGB)?",
    "answer": "In accordance with Section 1.1. of Annex III to the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) a “look through” approach should be applied to securitisations\n1\n. In the case of securitisation, all payments from the underlying debtors flow through the securitisation SPV to the investors in SPV.\nThe\noriginator/bank\nshould not include in its KPI the underlying assets (i.e. loans) sold to the securitisation SPV given that in the case of securitisation the originator/bank has no longer legal or economic ownership of these assets and does not carry those assets on its balance sheet. Only Taxonomy-aligned loans that are on the balance sheet of the originator should be included in the KPI of the originator.\nThe\ninvestor\nin the securities issued by a securitisation SPV should look through its exposure to the SPV and assess the Taxonomy-alignment of the underlying assets, using as appropriate either the method concerning the exposures with known use of proceeds or the KPI of the debtor for general purpose financing. The investor should count its exposure to securitisations into the numerator of its GAR to the extent that the underlying assets of the securitisation SPV are financing Taxonomy-aligned assets.\nIn relation to other exposures to SPVs, such as joint ventures or property-related transactions for example, reference is made to the response to question 13 in the\nsecond Commission Notice\n; this provides further guidance on Taxonomy reporting in such cases.\nStructured notes\nThe reporting of Taxonomy-alignment will depend on the structure of the note. Where the instrument can be classified as a bond or debt instrument where the use of proceeds is known, it will be reported as Taxonomy-aligned to the extent that the proceeds are financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or assets. Where the instrument is a bond or debt instrument where the use of proceeds is unknown, its Taxonomy-alignment will depend on the KPI of the issuer of the structured note.\nCovered bonds\nCovered bonds are bonds collateralised with specific assets on the balance sheet of the issuer of such bonds and which provide protection in the case of bankruptcy of that issuer. In contrast to securitisation, the issuer of covered bonds retains, until its bankruptcy, legal and economic ownership of the assets that serve as collateral for the covered bond and all payments by the underlying debtors flow to the issuer of covered bonds. The reporting of the Taxonomy-alignment of covered bonds should involve the following:\nthe issuer/originating bank\n– given that the assets (e.g. loans) used as collateral for the covered bond are kept on the balance sheet of the covered bond issuer, the covered bond issuer should disclose the Taxonomy-alignment of these assets used as collateral in the same way as it does for all of its other on-balance sheet assets\n2\n; and\nthe investor\n– for covered bonds where the use of proceeds in unknown, the investor should use the KPI of the covered bond issuer to compute the numerator of its own KPI and, for covered bonds where the use of proceeds is known, the investor should assess to what extent the proceeds are financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or assets.\n1\nFor further details, please see the response to question 13 of the\nsecond Commission Notice\n.\n2\nThe assessment of Taxonomy-alignment in the KPIs of financial undertakings should include all covered assets regardless of weather such assets are or are not used as collateral by reporting undertakings."

    "question": "Which input data and key performance indicators (KPIs) for which no externally reported information is available should be used for assessing the exposures of financial undertakings?",
    "answer": "Under Article 8(4) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) financial undertakings are required to use the most recently available data and KPIs of their counterparties to calculate their own KPIs. Therefore, if financial undertakings have no available data or KPIs from the counterparty or if these remain unfit for purpose to calculate their own KPIs, financial undertakings should use the most recently available data or KPIs disclosed in the previous year(s). Where such data and KPIs from previous years are also not available\n1\n, the exposure should be considered as non-eligible or not Taxonomy-aligned, i.e. financial undertakings should enter a zero value in the numerator of the relevant KPI for those exposures without any further assessment.\nFinancial undertakings, while conducting adequate due diligence (see also response to question 33 of the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2)), may use data obtained bilaterally from a counterparty that is not subject to sustainability reporting in accordance with Articles 19a or 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\n, and thus is also not reporting Taxonomy KPIs. This approach is particularly relevant for the calculation of the green asset ratio (GAR) on retail exposures covering residential real estate or house renovation loans, motor vehicle loans or the GAR on exposures to local governments\n2\n. With respect to exposures where the use of proceeds is known, financial undertakings should obtain adequate documentary evidence showing that all technical screening criteria (TSC) specified under the corresponding economic activity in the respective Delegated Acts are met to be able to count them as Taxonomy-aligned. For exposures to undertakings where the use of proceeds is known, financial undertakings should also verify that those undertakings meet the minimum social safeguards (see also the response to question 37 of this Notice).\nArticle 7(7) of the Disclosures Delegated Act only allows financial undertakings to use estimates for the regulatory reporting under the Disclosures Delegated Act of exposures to undertakings referred to in points (e) and (f) of Article 7(6) of that Act where those financial undertakings are able to demonstrate compliance with all criteria of Article 3 of\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852\n, except with the criteria laid down in Article 3, point (b) of that Regulation.

It should also not be more prominent than mandatory disclosures. If an undertaking includes voluntary reporting, it should add supporting detail to it setting out the basis for this disclosure, the methods used for its preparation, and a clear explanation of how it differs from mandatory reporting."

However, financial undertakings are also required to conduct adequate due diligence provided for in Directives 2009/65/EC\n1\n, 2009/138/EC\n2\n, and 2011/61/EU\n3\n,\nCapital Requirements Directive\n(CRD),\nMiFID\n, and ensure their own compliance with the applicable law. Disclosures provided by financial undertakings in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act (DDA) remain part of the sustainability reporting referred to in Articles 19a and 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\n, and therefore must, among other things, be reliable, comparable and relevant. For instance, point (i) of Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V DDA, in relation to loans and advances where the use of proceeds is known states that “\nFor the purposes of point (1)(c)(1), credit institutions shall consider the gross carrying amount of the exposures where the use of proceeds is known, including specialised lending exposures, to the non-financial undertaking to the extent and proportion that they finance a taxonomy-aligned economic activity. The assessment of whether that requirement has been met shall be based on information provided by the counterparty on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied.\n”\nTherefore, financial undertakings should check whether the information concerning Taxonomy-alignment of economic activities provided by their counterparties includes adequate documentary evidence that respective individual technical screening criteria (TSC) are met. For example, if the exposure of a financial undertaking finances an activity set out in Section 7.7. of Annex I to the\nClimate Delegated Act\n, the credit institution should check whether the real estate has an energy performance certificate (EPC) class A, on the basis of the (copy) of the EPC certificate provided by the client, and should receive the adequate documentary evidence that all DNSH criteria are met. A mere declaration by the client, without any supporting evidence, that the real estate in question meets the TSC set out in Section 7.7. of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act would not suffice to conclude that the respective real estate and the underlying exposure are Taxonomy-aligned. Similarly, where the TSC require verification by an independent third party, the credit institution should receive a (copy of) the verification report issued by the independent third party. A mere declaration by the client to the financial undertaking that the verification was performed would not suffice to infer Taxonomy-alignment of the economic activity. In the case of use of proceeds from environmentally sustainable bonds where the Taxonomy-alignment of the use of proceeds is verified by an independent third party, the credit institution should receive a copy of such a verification report to ascertain for itself the extent to which its exposure is financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or assets. The same evidence can be used to demonstrate compliance with the TSC for several exposures to which it pertains.\n1\nDirective 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (OJ L 302, 17.11.2009, p. 32).\n2\nDirective 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) (OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1).\n3\nDirective 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (OJ L 174, 1.7.2011, p. 1)."

    "question": "Do financial undertakings need to annually review the Taxonomy-alignment of their exposures?",
    "answer": "It is necessary that data on Taxonomy-alignment of exposures are reviewed, and, where necessary, revised annually to ensure that the sustainability statement includes a fair view of the development and performance of the undertaking's business, including its compliance with the technical screening criteria (TSC).\nBy virtue of the grandfathering clause in Article 7(5) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) applicable to special purpose loans and certain environmentally sustainable bonds or debt securities, if the TSC are amended, financial undertakings could report the Taxonomy-alignment of such loans and instruments with the amended TSC up to five years after the date of application of the amended TSC. It is therefore not necessary to check compliance with the amended TSC during the 5-year grandfathering period. Nevertheless, financial institutions are encouraged to engage with their counterparties in view of aligning their economic activities with the amended TSC during that transitional period."

    "question": "Where a credit institution offers, to a non-financial undertaking subject to Articles 19a or 29a of the Accounting Directive, a loan with a purpose of financing a project that is planned to be compliant with the technical screening criteria (TSC), can the credit institution rely on information gathered from that counterparty specifically related to that project, regardless of the counterparty’s overall Taxonomy disclosures?",
    "answer": "Point (i) of Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V to the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) states in relation to loans and advances where the use of proceeds is known, that: “\nFor the purposes of point (1)(c)(1), credit institutions shall consider the gross carrying amount of the exposures where the use of proceeds is known, including specialised lending exposures, to the non-financial undertaking to the extent and proportion that they finance a taxonomy-aligned economic activity. The assessment of whether that requirement has been met shall be based on information provided by the counterparty on the project or activities to which the proceeds will be applied.\n”\nTherefore, the credit institution’s assessment, of the extent to which a known use of proceeds loan to a non-financial undertaking subject to Articles 19a or 29a of the\nAccounting Directive\nis financing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or assets, should be based on information concerning the relevant activities financed by the proceeds, regardless of the non-financial undertaking’s reported KPIs. The credit institution, while conducting adequate due diligence, must collect all the data and information necessary to be able to evaluate all the TSC applicable to those activities or assets. This information should include adequate documentary evidence that respective individual TSC are met (see also replies to questions 33 and 36 of the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2))."

    "question": "In the case of retail clients, can credit institutions verify compliance with the technical screening criteria (TSC), in particular DNSH for adaptation, using specific evidence, e.g. domestic certifications or information in energy performance criteria (EPC))?",
    "answer": "Section 1.2.1.3. of Annex V to the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA) prescribes two categories of disclosures on retail exposures, namely:\nresidential real estate lending where compliance with the TSC as laid down in Sections 7.1., 7.2., 7.3., 7.4., 7.5., 7.6. and 7.7. of Annex I or Annex II to the\nClimate Delegated Act\nor Sections 3.1. and 3.2. of Annex II to the\nEnvironmental Delegated Act\nis required; and\nretail – credits/consumptions loans for cars, where compliance with the TSC as laid down in Section 6.5. of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act is required.\nWith respect to such retail exposures, credit institutions should obtain adequate documentary evidence showing that all TSC specified under the corresponding economic activity in the respective Delegated Acts are met (see also responses to question 33 of the Commission Notice on Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting (part 2)). This applies equally to the assessment of DNSH criteria for the climate change adaptation (CCA) objective. The evidence can be obtained directly from the client or can take the form of third-party independent and reliable verifications or external reviews, which could include domestic certifications by public authorities or information in EPCs. Evidence provided by third parties and public authorities could be relied upon to ascertain compliance with the TSC as long as it is specific and directly related to the underlying exposures of credit institutions. The same evidence can be used to demonstrate compliance with the TSC for several exposures to which it pertains.\nHowever, in the absence of exposure-specific evidence, estimates of Taxonomy-alignment may be disclosed on a voluntary basis separately from the mandatory key performance indicators (KPIs) together with the methodology used to calculate such estimates."

    "question": "Do financial undertakings have to comply with minimum safeguards in conducting their activities or is compliance with minimum safeguards only relevant at the level of the investee company?",
    "answer": "The specific requirement to comply with the minimum safeguards under Article 18 of the\nTaxonomy Regulation\napplies to the entity that performs an economic activity and which claims that its activity is Taxonomy-aligned.\nFor the purposes of computing in their key performance indicators (KPIs) the Taxonomy-alignment of exposures to other undertakings, financial undertakings themselves do not need to comply with the minimum safeguards given that financing activities are not as such Taxonomy-eligible. However, financial undertakings should obtain adequate documentary evidence, such as Taxonomy-disclosures by the non-financial undertakings under the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA), ascertaining that undertakings to which they are exposed meet the minimum safeguards to be able to compute as Taxonomy-aligned the exposures to those undertakings. Compliance with minimum safeguards is an integral part of the non-financial undertakings’ Taxonomy KPIs that financial undertakings apply to their exposures.\nAs for credit institutions’ green asset ratio (GAR) for known use of proceeds exposures, such as the exposures referred to in Sections 1.2.1.3. and 1.2.1.4. of Annex IV DDA regarding retail clients and public authorities, credit institutions do not need to verify compliance with minimum safeguards by those retail clients and public authorities. However, for those exposures, credit institutions should obtain adequate documentary evidence, such as Taxonomy-disclosures under the Disclosures Delegated Act by the respective producers of goods and service providers, ascertaining that undertakings producing goods and providing services that are purchased by retail clients and public authorities comply with the relevant technical screening criteria (TSC) and with minimum safeguards to compute their exposures as Taxonomy-aligned. This situation concerns for instance a loan provided to a retail client or public authority for the purchase of electric cars or solar panels where the credit institution needs to ascertain the compliance with the relevant TSC and the minimum safeguards by the manufacturer of those goods to assess such a loan as Taxonomy-aligned.\nFinancial undertakings should comply with the minimum safeguards only if the financial services they provide are Taxonomy-eligible and they claim that those services are Taxonomy-aligned. This concerns a small number of activities in Section 6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act on transport, which refers to “financing” as part of the activity description, and to non-life insurance and reinsurance underwriting activities in Sections 10.1. and 10.2. of Annex II to the\nClimate Delegated Act\n.\nFor guidance, undertakings are nonetheless invited to consult the\nCommission Notice of 16 June 2023 on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and links to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n. For further informal advice on best practices, they are invited to consult the\nFinal Report on Minimum Safeguards of the Platform on Sustainable Finance published in October 2022\n, in particular Sections 6 and 7."

    "question": "Where an insurance or a reinsurance undertaking computes the underwriting key performance indicator (KPI), should procedures relevant for compliance with minimum safeguards be applied by the undertaking at the level of its policyholders, in addition to its own compliance with those safeguards?",
    "answer": "Insurance and reinsurance undertakings that engage in Taxonomy-eligible activities referred to in Sections 10.1. and 10.2. of Annex II to the\nClimate Delegated Act\nand which are seeking to claim those activities as Taxonomy-aligned, should implement the appropriate due diligence procedures to ensure alignment with the minimum safeguards referred to in Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation.

    "answer": "With the exception of exposures referred to in Article 7(1) of the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n, a credit institution should include in AuM KPI assets that it manages based on the individual investment mandates received from the asset owners.\nIn the context of delegation of portfolio management of assets from another financial undertaking, assets where the delegatee provides portfolio management services should not be counted in the KPI of that delegatee but in the KPI of the delegator; this is to avoid double counting. Hence, as regards the AuM KPI in particular, credit institutions should not include assets for which portfolio management has been delegated to the credit institution by another financial undertaking (see also question 38 of this Notice).\nActivities other than portfolio management that are performed in relation to third-party assets should be assessed for Taxonomy-alignment in the green asset ratio (GAR) on Fees and Commissions."

Asset managers are therefore responsible for assessing Taxonomy-alignment of UCITS and AIFs for which they act as management companies in accordance with\nDirective 2009/65/EC\nand\nDirective 2011/61/EU\n, respectively, and of portfolios for which they provide individual portfolio management activities.

    "question": "Should repurchase agreement (repo) contracts be treated as “loans and advances” for EU Taxonomy purposes? In particular, can the alignment be assessed by inferring it from the counterparty’s key performance indicator (KPI), or by verifying compliance with the technical screening criteria (TSC) of the underlying economic activity?",
    "answer": "Repurchase agreements (‘repos’) that are recorded in the banking book should be considered as “loans and advances” for Taxonomy reporting purposes.\nA repurchase transaction is a form of collateralised lending where a securities seller (a borrower) agrees to sell those securities to a securities buyer (a lender) temporarily and both parties simultaneously agree to reverse this transaction at a specified later date. The transacted securities received by the lender act as collateral to secure its credit exposure to the borrower.\nA financial undertaking that is the borrower in the repurchase transaction should therefore account for the exposure to those securities in its own Taxonomy KPI during the term of the repurchase transaction. A financial undertaking that is the lender in the repurchase transaction should account for the repurchase transaction exposure as ‘loans and advances’ and use the KPI of the borrower to compute the numerator of its own Taxonomy KPI for the repo exposures in the banking book.\nSince the borrower remains the economic owner of the securities subject to the repurchase transaction and the lender is financing the borrower through the repurchase transaction, it is appropriate for the lender to use the KPI of the borrower, and not the KPI of the issuer of the collateral securities subject to the repurchase transaction, to compute the numerator of its own KPI."

    "answer": "In accordance with Section 1.2.1 of Annex V to the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA), for turnover based GAR, credit institutions should use the turnover KPI of their counterparty to compute the numerator of the GAR for the following exposures: equity instruments, general purpose debt securities, and general purpose loans and advances. Exposures to debt securities and loans, and repossessed collateral where the use of proceeds is known should be included in the numerator of the turnover-based GAR up to the amount that such exposures finance Taxonomy-aligned activities/expenditures based on the information provided by the counterparty without further weighting by the KPI of the counterparty.\nIn accordance with Section 1.2.1 of Annex V DDA, for CapEx based GAR, credit institutions should use the CapEx KPI of their counterparty to compute the numerator of the GAR for the following exposures: equity instruments, general purpose debt securities, and general purpose loans and advances. Exposures to debt securities and loans, and repossessed collateral where the use of proceeds is known should be included in the numerator of the CapEx-based GAR up to the amount that such exposures finance Taxonomy-aligned activities/expenditures based on the information provided by the counterparty without further weighting by the KPI of the counterparty.\nFor example, the calculation (1)(c)(1) + (1)(c)(2)\n1\nreferred to in Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V DDA should be performed twice on the same exposures. In the first calculation, general purpose exposures in (1)(c)(2), are weighted with the turnover KPIs of the counterparties to compute the turnover based GAR. In the second calculation, the general purpose exposures in (1)(c)(2) are weighted with the CapEx KPI of the counterparties.\nGeneral purpose loans are therefore included in both the turnover-based and the CapEx-based GAR. The turnover-based GAR should be reported in column 4 and the CapEx-based GAR should be reported in column 5 of the reporting template “0.

    "answer": "Every year, institutions should assess the outstanding amount of the loan in their balance sheet against the technical screening criteria (TSC) in force in that year. Where the TSC have a time limit for their application, the exposure is no longer aligned after the expiry of that time limit. If the criteria are amended by a delegated act and the financed activity or asset no longer complies with the new amended criteria, the underlying exposure will still be considered as Taxonomy-aligned for 5 years after the date of the application of the amending Delegated Act (grandfathering) in accordance with Article 7(5)\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n."

    "question": "How should NACE codes be assigned to exposures for the purpose of template 2 of green asset ratio (GAR) disclosures included in Annex VI to the Disclosures Delegated Act (DDA)? As the breakdown per NACE code is not required under disclosures by non-financial undertakings, where can credit institutions find that information to complete template 2 of Annex VI DDA? Given that some activities listed in the Disclosures Delegated Act do not have a NACE code, how can these be integrated in template 2 of Annex VI DDA?",
    "answer": "For the purpose of template 2 of GAR disclosures included in Annex VI to the\nDisclosures Delegated Act\n(DDA), the NACE code of the counterparty’s main activity should be provided. If the exposure refers to more than one entity, it should refer to the NACE code of the principal activity of the counterparty that was the most relevant, or determinant, for the institution to grant the exposure. If the counterparty is a holding company, the credit institution should consider the NACE sector of the principal activity of the specific counterparty controlled by the holding company (if different from the holding company) which received the funding. Similarly, credit institutions should disclose the relevant information under the NACE sector associated with the economic activity of the parent company of the special purpose vehicle. If the activity is not covered by a NACE code, the credit institution may use the code referred to in footnote (a) of the templates included in Annex II DDA."

    "answer": "The column “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” should be used to report exposures where the use of proceeds from the exposure is known and which are included in the green asset ratio (GAR) up to the amount that the exposure finances Taxonomy-aligned activities.\nFor example, where such exposures are:\nloan exposures to non-financial undertakings, the exposures that are to be reported in the “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” column on row 21 of template 3 correspond to the element (1)(c)(1) in Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V DDA. Correspondingly, the sum of the elements (1)(c)(1) + (1)(c)(2), in Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V DDA, should be reported in the column “\nProportion of total covered assets funding taxonomy relevant sectors (Taxonomy-aligned)\n” on row 21 of template 3;\ndebt security exposures to non-financial undertakings, the exposures that are to be reported in the “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” column on row 22 of template 3 correspond to the element (2)(c)(1) in Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V DDA. Correspondingly, the sum of the elements (2)(c)(1) + (2)(c)(2), in Section 1.2.1.1. of Annex V DDA should be reported in the column “\nProportion of total covered assets funding taxonomy relevant sectors (Taxonomy-aligned)\n” on row 22 of template 3;\nloan exposure to households that are covered in Section 1.2.1.3. of Annex V DDA, such exposures should be reported in the “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” column on rows corresponding to households in template 3. Because Section 1.2.1.3. DDA only covers exposures where the use of proceeds is known, the “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” column and the column “\nProportion of total covered assets funding taxonomy relevant sectors (Taxonomy-aligned)\n” should show the same values;\nloan or debt securities exposures to local governments that are covered in Section 1.2.1.4. of Annex V DDA, such exposures should be reported in the “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” column on rows corresponding to local governments in template 3. Because Section 1.2.1.4. covers only exposures where the use of proceeds is known, the “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” column and the column “\nProportion of total covered assets funding taxonomy relevant sectors (Taxonomy-aligned)\n” should show the same values.\nIn the columns “\nof which transitional\n” and “\nof which enabling\n”, institutions should report their exposures to transitional and enabling economic activities.\nThe column “\nof which Use of Proceeds\n” on one hand and the columns “\nof which transitional\n” and “\nof which enabling\n” on the other hand, do not represent mutually exclusive breakdowns. Therefore, they should not add up to, “\nProportion of total covered assets funding taxonomy relevant sectors (Taxonomy-aligned)\n”. The purpose of “\nof which\n” columns is rather to provide more specific information from two different perspectives, one about the type of financing and the other about the type of economic activity."

Credit institutions should therefore not compute the numerator and the denominator of the flow KPI as exposures on the disclosure reference date (T) minus exposures on the disclosure reference date (T-1).\n1\n1\nDoing so might result in negative values of the numerator or the denominator of the flow KPI or even in a mathematically undefined ratio (KPI) in case the exposures computed in the denominator on the date (T) are of the same amount as exposures in the denominator on the date (T-1). ﻿"

    "question": "How should reporting undertakings address ‘double-counting’ in the context of business activities contributing to multiple environmental objectives?",
    "answer": "Contribution to climate change mitigation (CCM) and climate change adaptation (CCA)\nBefore TSC for substantial contribution of activities to non-climate environmental objectives are established by future delegated acts, only Taxonomy-alignment with climate-related objectives may be assessed and disclosed (CCM) andCCA).\nThe contribution of a given activity to CCM or CCA should be assessed based on the nature of that activity.\nRegarding the CapEx KPI, and as mentioned in the last paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the nature and scope of CapEx in an activity that contributes substantially to CCM could in some cases be differentiated – and hence easy to distinguish – from CapEx that make that activity adapted to climate change. This could be the case in situations where the adaptation solution is external to the CCM-aligned asset (i.e. a separately identifiable and implemented measure/project) or where a solution is specified in the adaptation plan of the existing activity/asset. For example, the CapEx to build an on-shore wind farm that is located near the sea shore, which should be assessed for CCM, should be distinguished from the CapEx to protect this wind farm from sea rises or sea-shore erosion, which should be assessed for CCA.\nOn the other hand, where the adaptation solution is an inherent part of the design of the new asset that is itself CCM aligned\n(35)\nDNSH TSC to CCA require that, for new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations.\n, it could be difficult to distinguish CCA related CapEx from CCM related CapEx. In that case, CapEx under CCM could also cover the CapEx on the inherent adaptation solution. For example, a new off-shore wind farm would need to be designed to be resilient to the impacts of the rising seas (i.e. to fulfil DNSH to CCA) in order to be CCM aligned. It might be difficult for the operator to have knowledge of comparative CapEx of an off-shore windfarm that is not adapted to rising seas. In such situations, the CapEx should be reported under CCM objective only.\nRegarding the turnover KPI, in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 1.1.1. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the revenue generated from an activity that is adapted to climate change may not be computed in the numerator of the turnover KPI of the undertaking unless that activity:\nis an activity enabling CCA\n(36)\nActivities enabling substantial contribution to climate change adaptation such as certain types of engineering, insurance and education could report the turnover KPI for CCA but not for CCM because there are no SC criteria for CCM for such activities.\n, or;\nis aligned with CCM or any  non-climate environmental objective.\nThus, the turnover generated from an on-shore wind farm that is adapted to climate change may only be counted in the turnover KPI of the undertaking where that wind farm is Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCM and should be reported under the CCM objective. The turnover KPI for adaptation would not be reported for activities that are only adapted.\nFor adapted activities enabling a substantial contribution to CCA, the undertaking could count that respective turnover in the numerator of the turnover KPI under the CCA objective (column 6) with an E tag (column 20). Where such an activity also contributes substantially to CCM (e.g. afforestation), the undertaking could count that respective turnover in the numerator of the turnover KPI under the CCM objective (column 5)\n(37)\nWhere the activity referred to in the previous sentence is not enabling, the turnover KPI under CCM objective should be reported on a separate line without the E tag. In all cases, the undertaking should avoid double counting in accordance with Section 1.2.2.2 of Annex I. KPI reported in column 4 should be the same figure as in column 18.\n. For example, a non-financial undertaking could report turnover from an afforestation activity in a location prone to risk of droughts with climate adapted trees (e.g. drought resistant trees) under the CCM objective (column 5) and report turnover from selling drought resistant seeds and saplings under the CCA objective (column 6). The undertaking should apply a similar approach to OpEx and report OpEx related to afforestation under CCM objective and OpEx related to selling adapted seeds and saplings under CCA objective.\nFor activities contributing substantially to CCM, treatment of CapEx\n(38)\nTurnover of such an activity would be recognised in the numerator of the turnover KPI only after the activity becomes Taxonomy-aligned.\nto meet DNSH criteria for  non-climate environmental objectives\nFor activities contributing substantially to CCM, reporting undertakings may incur CapEx to meet DNSH criteria for  non-climate environmental objectives. For example, a car manufacturer, which is operating a factory producing electric vehicles\n(39)\nSee Climate Delegated Act, Annex I, Section 3.3. ’Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’.\n, which meet substantial contribution (SC) criteria for CCM, may need to incur CapEx to meet DNSH criteria for the objectives of circular economy or pollution prevention in order to make the production of those vehicles Taxonomy-aligned. That CapEx should not be reported under those environmental objectives (column 8 or 9 of the template in Annex II) because, for those objectives, the activity only meets DNSH level of performance and no TSC for substantial contribution has yet been established for those objectives\n(40)\nOnce TSC are established for SC towards those objectives, additional CapEx might be needed to make the activity contribute substantially towards those objectives.\n. Instead, that CapEx should be reported under the CCM objective (column 5 of the template in Annex II), because it is incurred in the context of making an activity contributing substantially to CCM a Taxonomy-aligned activity by meeting DNSH criteria for other objectives.\nTreatment of an activity making substantial contribution to multiple environmental objectives (other than only to CCM and CCA)\nAfter TSC for economic activities contributing to environmental objectives are established in a future delegated act, some economic activities may be able to make a substantial contribution to multiple environmental objectives, other than only to CCM and CCA.\nThe reporting of such activities under the Disclosures Delegated Act, in particular under Section 1.2.2.2. of Annex I, may be further clarified once the relevant TSC are established."

On the other hand, this CapEx is part of the undertaking’s CapEx KPI and would be counted in the GAR/GIR of the financial undertaking for a second time as part of calculation of the financial undertaking’s KPI based on the CapEx KPIs of investee undertakings. To avoid double counting, financial undertakings should use an adjusted CapEx KPI that the non-financial undertaking should disclose alongside their non-adjusted KPIs\n(46)\nlast paragraph of Article 7(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.\n.\nThis Taxonomy-aligned CapEx, that was paid from the proceeds of the sustainable bond, represents creation of, or addition to, Taxonomy-aligned assets/equipment that could be used in the production process to produce Taxonomy-aligned output and hence turnover. That Taxonomy-aligned turnover would be part of the non-financial undertaking’s turnover KPI. Consequently, the same Taxonomy-aligned turnover would be reflected in financial undertaking’s GAR/GIR on the one hand through the inclusion of the sustainability bond directly in the GAR/GIR and, on the other hand, would be counted in the GAR/GIR a second time by including other exposures, multiplied by the turnover KPI, to that non-financial undertaking. To avoid double counting, financial undertakings should use an adjusted turnover KPI that the non-financial undertaking should, until the maturity of the sustainable bond, disclose alongside their non-adjusted KPIs.\nRegarding the disclosure of CapEx and/or OpEx KPIs, non-financial undertakings that issued use of proceeds sustainable bond(s) that finance part or all of their CapEx and/or, where relevant, OpEx during the reporting period, should disclose also adjusted CapEx and/or OpEx KPIs so that financial undertakings avoid double-counting that CapEx and/or OpEx in their other exposures to non-financial undertaking\n(47)\nSee the last paragraphs of section 1.2.3.2 of Annex I\n. In the adjusted Capex and OpEx KPIs, a portion of Taxonomy-aligned CapEx and/or OpEx, incurred during the reporting period, that is paid with the proceeds from the issuance of use of proceeds sustainable bonds should be deducted from the numerator of the adjusted CapEx and/or OpEx KPIs.\nSimilarly for turnover KPIs, non-financial undertakings that issue use of proceeds sustainable bond(s) that fund (a portion of) Taxonomy-aligned assets (and their associated CapEx and OpEx) that are employed in production of Taxonomy-aligned turnover during the reporting period, should, until the maturity of the sustainable bond(s), disclose also adjusted turnover KPIs\n(48)\nSee the last paragraph of section 1.2.3.1. of Annex I\n.

While revenue from discontinued operations needs to be presented separately from continuing operations (IFRS 5.33) and, therefore, cannot be included in the revenue line item as required by IAS 1.82(a), revenue from\nnon-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale remains part of the continuing operations and, therefore, is included in the revenue line item as required by IAS 1.82(a).\nAssets that are part of\nnon-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale or a discontinued operation must be reclassified according to IFRS 5 and reported together in a separate balance sheet item. Until the date of IFRS 5 classification or, in the case of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale, also after this date, additions to the balance sheet that generally meet the CapEx definition, can be made within the financial year. In the case of non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale and discontinued operation, all additions that meet the Capex definition must be taken into account in the calculation of the CapEx KPI.\nIn addition, the reporting entities should provide contextual information pursuant to Section 1.2.3. of Annex I concerning any current and future impact from non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale and discontinued operations on the turnover KPI and CapEx KPI."

    "question": "How should reporting undertakings assess the Taxonomy-eligibility of economic activities for climate change adaptation (CCA) under Article 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy-eligibility of activities for climate change mitigation (CCM) or enabling climate change adaptation (see question 19 of this Notice), may be assessed solely based on the description of the activity, irrespective of whether the activity meets the TSC (in line with the replies to questions 3 and 9 of the first Commission Notice).\nWith respect to adapted activities (see questions 8 and 19 of this Notice), for assessing the Taxonomy-eligibility of activities for CCA in accordance with Article 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the title or the description of the economic activity spelled out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act is not decisive in itself for making a substantial contribution to CCA. A reporting undertaking should rather consider the adaptation solutions that it puts in place that could make the economic activity adapted/more resilient to climate change. In line with the reply to question 5 of the first Commission Notice, to demonstrate the Taxonomy-eligibility of an activity, an undertaking has to perform a climate risk and vulnerabilities assessment of the most important physical climate risks that are material to its economic activity. In addition, the undertaking must put in place a plan outlining how and by when adaptation solutions will be put in place to counter these physical risks. For instance, if a manufacturer of cement identifies that its manufacturing site is prone to avalanches, the entity may put in place a plan to install structural protection measures to hold back avalanches, such as avalanche barriers or snow racks. The existence of such a plan based on a climate risk and vulnerabilities assessment makes the economic activity Taxonomy-eligible for CCA. This Taxonomy-eligibility does not require the economic activity to meet all the TSC for CCA, i.e. to ensure that the adaptation solutions have already been implemented."

  {
    "question": "What is the Taxonomy-aligned share of turnover and corresponding CapEx/OpEx from activities listed in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act distinguishes between three types of economic activities eligible for climate change adaptation (CCA):\nAdapted activities\n:\nThese are economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to CCA by being made climate resilient/adapted. This implies putting in place adaptation solutions that can counter the most important physical climate risks that threaten the activity, as identified in a climate risk and vulnerability assessment. These activities qualify as Taxonomy-aligned where they meet points 1 to 4 in the generic substantial contribution criteria for adaptation. For instance, if a manufacture of cement identifies that its manufacturing site is prone to avalanches, the entity may put in place a plan to install structural protection measures to hold back avalanches, such as avalanche barriers or snow racks. For these activities, only the CapEx and OpEx associated with putting in place the adaptation solutions can count as Taxonomy-aligned. The turnover of that activity may only be considered as Taxonomy-aligned if the activity itself is also Taxonomy-aligned (see Section 1.1.1 of Annex I) with respect to climate change mitigation (CCM) and then it should be counted towards the CCM objective only, or, when a delegated regulation adopted in accordance with Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation enters into force, any other environmental objective (see replies to questions 5 and 8 of the first Commission Notice).  Otherwise, these activities can only be reported under CapEx and OpEx KPIs.\nEnabling activities\n:\nThese are activities that can make a substantial contribution by providing adaptation solutions themselves that can enable another economic activity to reach a substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives referred to in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The enabling character of these activities is explicitly stated in their description\n(49)\nThe following sentence is added in the description of the activity:\n”An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1) point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria set out this section.”\n. In addition, they do not follow the generic criteria of substantial contribution to CCA. These activities are limited to the following activities listed in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act:\n9.1. Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change;\n9.2. Close to market research, development and innovation;\n10.1. Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils;\n10.2. Reinsurance.\nFor these activities the turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated with meeting the TSC set out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act can count as Taxonomy-aligned.\nAdapted-enabling activities\n:\nThese are economic activities that combine the types 1 and 2 outlined above as they can make a substantial contribution to CCA by:\nbecoming adapted themselves (adapted activity), and\nenabling other activities to make a substantial contribution (enabling activity).\nThese activities are identified by the following sentence in the description of the activity “\nWhere an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section\n” . The activities that fall under this type must comply with the generic criteria for substantial contribution to CCA set out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act with additional criteria related to the enabling character. Therefore, if the activity meets points 1 to 4 of the criteria for substantial contribution, it can qualify as an adapted activity. If it meets, in addition, point 5 of those criteria, the activity can also qualify as enabling. However, the activity first needs to be adapted itself to qualify as enabling. For instance, a school that is prone to subsidence may put in place concrete underpinning or jet grouting to make it resilient to climate change, therefore qualifying as an adapted activity. In addition, the school may offer some climate-related courses, which may stimulate individual climate action.\nFor these activities, the CapEx and OpEx associated with putting in place the adaptation solutions to make it climate resilient can count as Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCA\n(50)\nSections 1.1.2.2, final paragraph, and Section 1.1.3.2, fourth paragraph of Annex I.\n(in the above example, the CapEx for the concrete underpinning or jet grouting). In addition, the turnover and associated CapEx and OpEx of providing the adaption solution itself (e.g. climate related courses) can count as Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCA."

    "question": "When should an undertaking be required to report under the Disclosures Delegated Act an economic activity that has not been performed by the reporting entity itself but by a subcontractor?",
    "answer": "Reporting entities must report turnover from the activities performed by a subcontractor in accordance with the accounting treatment referred to in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Therefore, the reporting entity should determine whether it recognises revenue arising from that activity as its own revenue under the principles set out in the applicable IFRS 15. Where revenue generated by a subcontractor is recognised as the revenue of the reporting entity, it must be included in the calculation of the turnover KPI.\nAs an example: An entity is an actor in the logistics industry, and it provides freight transport services by road to its customers (activity 6.6 “\nfreight transport services by road”\ndescribed in the Climate Delegated Act as\n“purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of vehicles designated as…”\n). To deliver such transportation services, the entity either owns directly and operates some vehicles, or it outsources a portion of its activities by contracting with subcontractors or third party transport providers to provide the transport services to its customers, without puchasing, leasing, or operating directly the designated vehicles.\nTurnover is generated for the whole activity of transportation services independently of how (by whom) the services are performed; an outsourced activity is part of the general activity 6.6 “\nfreight transport services by road”\neven if the entity does not purchase, rent nor directly operate the vehicles. For this outsourced portion of activities, the turnover KPI to be considered for Taxonomy disclosures is the one derived from the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 15.34 to B3.\nWhere the entity is determined as being a principal in the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the financial statements, it recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred. When an entity that is an agent satisfies the performance obligation, it recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. As indicated in Section 1.1.1 of Annex 1 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, the turnover shall cover the revenue recognised pursuant to IAS 1.82 (a)."

    "question": "How should reporting undertakings disclose turnover from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities whose output is used or consumed internally?",
    "answer": "The disclosure of data under Section 1.2.3.1 point (b) of Annex I on\n“the amounts related to taxonomy aligned activities pursued for non-financial undertakings’ own internal consumption”,\nis an element of contextual information allowing reporting undertakings to explain whether and how the outputs of internal sales or consumption of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities have evolved over the reporting period, alongside the main drivers and elements of change in their turnover KPI\n(51)\nThe cost of internal sales/consumption of Taxonomy-aligned activities may qualify as OpEx under point (c) of section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I.\n. This information allows reporting undertakings to disclose where and how outputs of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (e.g. Taxonomy-aligned renewable energy) may have been diverted for internal consumption and consequently, do not feature in their turnover KPI, which only records external sales."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should reporting undertakings allocate the turnover to economic activities which provide multiple services or products to customers?",
    "answer": "The accounting treatment referred to in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I must be applied. In particular, IFRS 15 sets out criteria for the recognition of revenue on the basis of the performance obligations satisfied by the reporting entity, including cases in which multiple performance obligations constitute one single bundle to which revenue is entirely allocated. For the purpose of reporting the turnover KPI, those criteria should be followed to determine how to allocate revenue to different economic activities when multiple performance obligations are satisfied for the same customer or group of customers.\nFor example, an entity enters a contract to build a renewable energy production infrastructure for a customer. The entity is responsible for the overall management of the project and identifies various promised good or services, including engineering, site clearance, foundation, procurement, construction of the structure, installation of equipment and technologies, and finishing. The allocation of the turnover from this project to different economic activities follows the analysis that has been made in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 15, i.e. depending on whether the goods and services are distinct or not from the accounting perspective. If the goods and services are distinct, the turnover is split into and allocated to the corresponding underlying economic activities."

    "question": "How should reporting undertakings treat public funding and subsidies received to finance their CapEx?",
    "answer": "The source of financing (e.g. public or private, external or internal to the undertaking, or their combination) of the CapEx of non-financial undertakings has no relevance for the purpose of assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of that CapEx. Reporting undertakings should consider all their CapEx for the purpose of assessing its Taxonomy-alignment regardless of the source of its financing."

Does this time period apply both to a plan to expand a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity as well as to upgrade a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity into a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity?",
    "answer": "The five to ten-year time period for the CapEx plan referred to in Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I should start from its approval by the management body, or by another body approving it by delegation. The time period applies both to a plan to expand an undertaking’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to a plan to upgrade or commence Taxonomy-eligible economic activities with a view to rendering them Taxonomy-aligned."

    "answer": "The start date of individual measures\nreferred to in point (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I should be aligned with the moment in time when accounting rules (for example, in IAS 16(7) for tangible assets and IAS 38(21) for intangible assets) recognise the associated CapEx in the financial statement and not at the point when the contract for the delivery of the Taxonomy-aligned output, service or measure is concluded."

    "question": "How comprehensive and precise should a CapEx plan be to be counted in the numerator of the CapEx KPI? Would the expansion of an existing Taxonomy-aligned economic activity in the same facility count as CapEx under point (a) or (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. of Annex I?",
    "answer": "The CapEx plan referred to in Section\n1.1.2.2. of Annex I should identify all planned measures that are necessary to ensure compliance of the economic activity with the TSC and include a description of those measures, expenditures related to those measures and their timing, including significant intermediary milestones, to allow effective monitoring by investors of the implementation of the investment plan\n(52)\nIt is recommended that undertakings integrate their CapEx plans into their transition plans referred to in CSRD.\n. Expenditures which are not related to ensuring that the activity meets the criteria, e.g. decorative aspects of the facility in which the activity is performed with no bearing on environmental performance should not be included. OpEx which is necessary to ensure the effective functioning and day-to-day servicing of Taxonomy-aligned assets should be included as relevant in the OpEx plan in accordance with points (a) and (b) of Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I.\nIn order to determine whether the expansion of an existing Taxonomy-aligned economic activity would count as CapEx under point (a) or (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. of Annex I, one should consider when the expansion would be completed and become operational in relation to the moment where its related CapEx is incurred. If the expansion becomes operational in the same financial period when all the CapEx related to it is incurred, it could be counted under point (a) of Section 1.1.2.2. (i.e. there is no need to use the CapEx plan for the expansion). On the other hand, where the expansion takes place over several financial periods, CapEx will be incurred in financial periods before the expansion is completed. In order to count that CapEx as Taxonomy-aligned in the financial period when it was incurred while the expansion is not yet completed, the undertaking should use the CapEx plan under point (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. The purpose of the CapEx plan is to provide a degree of assurance that the expanded activity will be Taxonomy-aligned when completed and allow, on that basis, to count CapEx as already Taxonomy-aligned while incurred in the periods before the expansion is completed. In both cases, after completion, the expanded activity needs to meet the relevant TSCs."

    "question": "How should the Taxonomy-aligned value of CapEx be presented on points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I?",
    "answer": "In line with Section 1.2.3.2. “\nContextual information about CapEx KPI”\nof Annex I, different CapEx items under points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I related to Taxonomy-aligned economic activities must be presented at activity-level. This means that relevant values of different CapEx items are to be presented in an aggregate form with respect to an activity. In the case of an undertaking with multiple Taxonomy-eligible/aligned economic activities, the presentation must make clear to which activity a CapEx item relates. Where individual values of relevant Taxonomy-aligned CapEx according to points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I could be distinguished, reporting undertakings could choose to itemise them as such in the template in Annex II under one relevant activity. The total value of relevant Taxonomy-aligned CapEx for a relevant activity must be the sum of the items in points (a), (b) and (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 across relevant Taxonomy-aligned activities. The values of the different items should also be appropriately explained as part of the specifications and contextual information required under Section 1.2 of Annex I."

  {
    "question": "How should CapEx and OpEx integrated in value chains be disclosed in the situation where the reporting undertaking is performing both the upstream and the downstream Taxonomy-eligible economic activity?",
    "answer": "In the situation where an intermediate upstream activity is defined in the Climate Delegated Act as a standalone activity, the CapEx or OpEx associated with that activity should be assessed independently from the use of the output resulting from that activity for another downstream activity that is also defined in the Climate Delegated Act. For instance, if an undertaking produces cement (activity listed in Section 3.7 of Annex I to Climate Delegated Act) and it is using that cement for the construction of a building, the CapEx associated with meeting the TSC for cement is Taxonomy-aligned regardless of whether the construction of the building is Taxonomy-aligned. Reference is also made to question 21 of this Notice regarding how undertakings should disclose turnover from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities whose output is used or consumed internally."

  {
    "question": "How should CapEx be assessed with regard to Taxonomy-alignment if the asset that the CapEx is financing might be used for various projects?",
    "answer": "To avoid greenwashing and provide for an accurate reporting, it is necessary to only allocate the proportion of CapEx which is effectively assisting Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. Reporting entities should use a non-financial metric that provides for an accurate allocation of the CapEx to a Taxonomy-aligned activity. For instance, if the asset that is financed by CapEx produces 100 units of output that are Taxonomy-aligned and 100 units of output that are not Taxonomy-aligned, the reporting undertaking could report 50% of that CapEx as Taxonomy-aligned. The methodology used to allocate CapEx to Taxonomy-aligned activities should be based on verifiable evidence.\nThe reporting undertaking should also provide contextual information under Section 1.2.3 of Annex I concerning:\nthe allocation of CapEx to multiple projects, and\nthe methodology to allocate the CapEx to Taxonomy-aligned activities."

Therefore, if research and development cannot be associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, it may not be accounted in the numerator of the OpEx KPI.

    "answer": "Maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures in the denominator of the OpEx KPI relate principally to physical assets. However, maintenance and repair or other direct costs could be also relevant for intangible assets (e.g. right-of-use assets, software).

    "question": "To what undertakings does the reporting obligation under the Taxonomy Regulation Article 8 Delegated Act apply?",
    "answer": "The Delegated Act supplementing Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2021/2178) (“the Disclosures Delegated Act”) sets out specific requirements for Taxonomy-related reporting by undertakings covered by Directive EU 2014/95 (the Non-Financial Reporting Directive)\n(2)\nDirective 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups, OJ L 330, 15.11.2014, p. 1.\n.\nSpecifically, Article 8(1) of Regulation EU 2020/852\n(3)\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, OJ L 198, 22.6.2020, p. 13.\n(the Taxonomy Regulation) contains a cross reference to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive EU 2013/34\n(4)\nDirective 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC, OJ L 182, 29.6.2013, p. 19.\n(the Accounting Directive)  which were introduced by Directive EU 2014/95 (the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)). More precisely, the Taxonomy Regulation specifies that ‘\nany undertaking which is subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU shall include in its non-financial statement or consolidated non-financial statement information on how and to what extent the undertaking’s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under Articles 3 and 9 of this Regulation\n'. In other words, undertakings that are subject to mandatory reporting obligations under the Accounting Directive, also have reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation .\n.\nIn accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive, the following undertakings are subject to the obligation to publish non-financial information: a large undertaking as defined in Article 3(4) of that Directive which is a public-interest entity as defined in Article 2 point (1) of that Directive with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year; and a public-interest entity which is a parent undertaking of a large group as defined in Article 3(7) of that Directive with more than 500 employees on average on a consolidated basis during the financial year. Based on Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, such undertakings are also subject to the Taxonomy Regulation related disclosure obligations.\nArticle 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation does not specifically refer to national measures transposing the NFRD that potentially extend the scope of its application to cover other categories of smaller undertakings. Therefore, the reporting requirements under Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation apply to undertakings directly in the scope of the NFRD. They do not apply to those undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD. However, under the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD can report their alignment with the Taxonomy voluntarily."

  {
    "question": "How is an 'economic activity' defined in the Disclosures Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Regulation lays down a classification of environmentally sustainable economic activities. This classification is largely based on the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE), the statistical classification of economic activities in the EU.\nAn economic activity takes place when resources such as capital, goods, labour, manufacturing techniques or intermediary products are combined to produce specific goods or services. It is characterised by an input of resources, a production process and an output of products (goods or services).\nRegulation EU 2021/2139 (the Climate Delegated Act)\n(5)\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1.\ndescribes and assigns criteria on a high level. It does not refer to only one specific economic activity, but rather to categories of economic activities. For example, it sets criteria for the general category ‘manufacture of cement’, rather than the manufacturing of cement in one specific plant by one specific operator.\nThe reference to NACE sectors in the Climate Delegated Act is only indicative and not necessarily exhaustive. Therefore, an economic activity could match the description of an activity and the technical screening criteria laid out the Climate Delegated Act (Annexes I and II thereof) even if the NACE sector of the company is not listed in the relevant section of the Climate Delegated Act."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity?",
    "answer": "Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act defines an eligible economic activity as an activity that is described in the delegated acts adopted under Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. For the reporting period ending in 2022 (and for activities conducted in 2021), this definition corresponds to economic activities described in the Climate Delegated Act as adopted on 4 June 2021.\nMore specifically, according to Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, an economic activity is eligible irrespective of whether it meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down in the Climate Delegated Act (and future delegated acts). Therefore, the fact that an economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible does not give any indication of the environmental performance and sustainability of that activity.\nIn principle, if an undertaking generates turnover or invests in capital expenditure (CapEx) or operating expenditure (OpEx) corresponding to an economic activity that is described in the Climate Delegated Act, it would count as eligible for Taxonomy-eligibility disclosure. On the contrary, if an activity is not yet included in the Delegated Act, it should not be considered as being eligible. Furthermore, the Taxonomy is a dynamic framework that should expand its scope of activities overtime, in particular by including other environmental objectives, which should expand the scope of eligible activities accordingly.\nIn practical terms, identifying Taxonomy-eligible economic activities is the first step towards assessing the alignment of economic activities with the Taxonomy technical screening criteria. Eligible activities constitute the baseline universe of activities that have the potential to align with the technical screening criteria, including as transitional or enabling activities.\nAs a general principle, eligibility reporting, in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, should serve to help undertakings prepare for their future alignment disclosures\n(6)\nFor the sake of clarity, it is noted that eligible activities do not equal to the denominator of the taxonomy alignment KPI. For non-financial undertakings total CapEx, OpEx and turnover will be used. Covered assets for the KPI of financial undertakings.\n.\nFinally, the Taxonomy Regulation, the Climate Delegated Act and the Disclosures Delegated Act do not differentiate between\ncore and non-core\neconomic or business activities. Therefore, undertakings should report all of their economic activities in line with the definition of eligibility under Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, as explained above.\nThe timeline for eligibility and alignment disclosures is further described in the FAQs Question 2,\npublished on 20 December 2021\n."

    "question": "What are 'enabling' and ´transitional´ economic activities in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?",
    "answer": "Articles 16 and 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation define enabling and transitional economic activities.\n(7)\nPlease refer to Articles 10(2) and 16 of the\nTaxonomy Regulation EU 2020/852\n.\nTransitional activities are those for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and that have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry, which fulfil the two following conditions: (i) they should not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and (ii) they should not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the economic lifetime of those assets. On the other hand, enabling activities are those that directly enable others to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective.\nFor eligibility reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, economic activities defined as enabling or transitional activities should not be treated differently from other activities.  If they are within the scope of the respective description, they should be identified as eligible.\nIt is noted however that an economic activity is only transitional or enabling under EU Taxonomy provided it meets the technical screening criteria in the respective section of Annex I and II to the Climate Delegated Act. Therefore, and in particular for the first year(s) of eligibility reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, those activities can only be considered as eligible-to be-transitional or eligible-to-be-enabling and reported i.e marked as such, on a voluntary basis. This is not different from eligibility reporting for other activities, where eligibility does not give an indication of the environmental performance of the activity."

    "answer": "There are two different types of activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act:\nadaptation activities, i.e. activities including adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n(8)\nArticle 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation EU 2020/852 refers to activities. including adaptation solutions that either substantially reduce the risk of the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate on that economic activity or substantially reduce that adverse impact, without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on people, nature or assets;\nenabling economic activities, i.e. activities providing adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(b)  of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n(9)\nArticle 11 (1)(b) of the Taxonomy Regulation refers to activities thatprovide adaptation solutions that, in addition to satisfying the conditions set out in Article 16, contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate on people, nature or assets, without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature or assets..\nEligibility reporting requirements differ depending on whether the economic activity is marked as an enabling activity or an adaptation activity in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act. For the former category (enabling activities), the turnover and corresponding CapEx and OpEx can qualify as eligible activities.\n(10)\nIn accordance with recital 48 of the Climate Delegated Act ‘...However, when the core business of economic activities enabling adaptation in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is to provide technologies, products, services, information, or practices with the objectives of increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, nature, cultural heritage, assets or of other economic activities, in addition to capital expenditure, the turnover derived from products or services associated with those economic activities should be considered as proportion of turnover derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable.’\nFor the latter category (adaptation activities), the reporting entity needs to demonstrate that a climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been performed and that an expenditure plan has been set up to implement adaptation solutions that reduce the activity’s most significant physical climate risks as set out in\nAppendix A\nto Annex II. Only if these requirements are fulfilled can the reporting entity count the CapEx and OpEx of the adaptation activity for Taxonomy eligibility.\nIt is important to note here that the turnover derived from products and services associated with an adapted activity cannot be recognised for Taxonomy eligibility. This is because once the substantial contribution to climate change adaptation of an activity has taken place (i.e. once the activity has been made resilient to climate change), the turnover corresponding to that activity should not count as eligible. Note that the adapted activity may or may not provide environmental benefits."

    "question": "How should NACE codes be used to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities in the context of eligibility-reporting?",
    "answer": "NACE is a classification system for products and economic activities. NACE codes provide a framework to collect and present a wide range of statistics in economic fields, based on economic activity.\nNACE uses four levels. The National transpositions of NACE codes sometimes include more than four levels, but the first four levels are the same for all Member States.\nAll descriptions of economic activities included in Annexes I and II to the Climate Delegated Act provide that the economic activities in the respective category can correspond to one or more specific NACE codes.\nFurthermore, recital 6 of the Climate Delegated Act clarifies that the references to NACE codes should be understood as indicative. The assessment of Taxonomy eligibility should be made in view of the specific description of the activity provided in the Annexes of the Climate Delegated Act.\nMore specifically, NACE codes should help users navigate through the Taxonomy, in particular those users that already work with NACE codes. NACE codes can help identify taxonomy-eligible activities (not aligned ones). However, only the specific activity description in the Climate Delegated Act sets out the exact scope of the activities included in the Act.\nIn practice, this means that:\nif a NACE code is broader than the activity description, the description prevails over the scope of the NACE code;\nif an economic activity does not have a NACE code but does meet the activity description, it can qualify as Taxonomy-eligible;\nif an activity description does not fully correspond to the undertaking’s activity, it might be necessary to segment the undertaking’s activities so the respective parts can fall under the activity description or under several activities that are described separately;\nif the NACE code of an economic activity is not mentioned in the Climate Delegated Act, but the economic activity corresponds to the description of the activity, it can qualify as Taxonomy eligible."

    "question": "Can undertakings report voluntary information in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?",
    "answer": "As a general rule, the Disclosures Delegated Act does not preclude voluntary disclosures of undertakings’ activities. On the contrary, all undertakings subject to the reporting obligation are encouraged to voluntarily report any relevant additional information where they consider that this is relevant to investors to gain a better understanding of the entity's taxonomy-eligibility.\nNevertheless, and as a general principle for all undertakings, voluntary disclosures are not part of the mandatory disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and entities should always explain the reasons for making such disclosures.\nMoreover, voluntary disclosures should not contradict or misrepresent mandatory information under the Disclosures Delegated Act. Voluntary disclosures should also not be more prominent than mandatory disclosures.

  {
    "question": "How far should undertakings assess and report Taxonomy eligible activities in their value chain, both upstream and downstream?",
    "answer": "Generally, reporting on Taxonomy eligible activities does not entail an assessment of an undertaking’s value-chain, as\nin most cases\nthe descriptions of the activities in the Climate Delegated Act do not contain value-chain references. Likewise, companies are not expected to assess the sustainability of their suppliers in particular in the phase of eligibility reporting.\nThe Taxonomy sets criteria per sector and activity, not per product line or company. Companies that generate revenue in several sectors within the value chain of one product, must disclose the various processes and parts in the value chain across those sectors and activities. This applies to activities that are carried out by the reporting entity, not by its suppliers. Operators that are active in several sectors across the value chain of one product or technology, but generate revenue from that product only under one activity, must disclose only under that specific revenue-generating activity.\nFor reporting turnover, assets and processes in the value chain of an activity are only eligible if they are explicitly included in the activity description. For example, if the description only refers to manufacturing of final products, intermediary activities in the value chain are not automatically eligible. Accordingly, manufacturing  specific car and vehicle components is not automatically eligible under the section ‘manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’”. From a supplier's perspective, this means that the activity of a company that is a supplier to a Taxonomy-eligible activity is not by definition Taxonomy-eligible and the manufacturing of specific components for cars is not by default eligible under the activity “manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport”. This is because the EU Taxonomy does not take a blanket approach for upstream activities. Instead it sets out specific criteria for each included activity, including the relevant ‘do no significant harm’ criteria.\nHowever, certain key components that are spelled out in separate Sections, such as for batteries or hydrogen (in Sections 3.2 and 3.4) are eligible.  Furthermore, the manufacture of components can qualify under the section “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” (Section 3.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act) where not covered by other sections and where they meet the activity description. As the activity description in Section 3.6 is very broad, NACE codes C22, C25, C26, C27 and C28 should be considered as advice for the scope of this activity. The scope of NACE codes for this activity notably includes tyres and semi-conductors, if those products meet the activity description (see also question 19).  Mining, by contrast, would not be covered by the description.\nFor reporting CapEx and OpEx, all purchases of assets and processes or services that are essential to carry out  a particular eligible activity are eligible as well. The components that car manufacturers purchase to manufacture low-carbon cars are eligible. Under eligibility reporting, the car- or vehicle manufacturers do not need to screen their suppliers and individual purchases. They must only determine whether their own manufacturing process is a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity. If the own activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible, the CapEx for investments in essential assets or components corresponding to that activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible. Another example is the purchase of software that is essential to develop or use  ICT solutions for climate change mitigation, if these solutions are eligible under activity 8.2.\nFrom a client’s perspective, the purchase of outputs of Taxonomy-eligible activities is not by definition Taxonomy-eligible. For example, the purchase of renewable energy does not by definition qualify as Taxonomy eligible\n(13)\nThis may be reviewed overtime in light of the Fit for 55 package and climate goals agreed by the Council and the European Parliament.\n. The purchase of Taxonomy-eligible output is only eligible when it can be reported as one of the various types of CapEx or OpEx described in Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, in particular such as for example the installation of solar panels on buildings covered by category (c) of CapEx mentioned in Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of to the Disclosures Delegated Act (see also Question 11)."

    "question": "How to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities of which activity descriptions contain qualifiers, such as ‘low carbon’, and ‘climate-related perils’?",
    "answer": "The activity descriptions in the Climate Delegated Act serve as a reference point to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities. However, some descriptions contain “qualifiers” which could be understood in a subjective way, such as “low carbon”, which may in some cases impact the eligibility.\nEligibility does not depend on compliance with the technical screening criteria but is assessed solely on the basis of the description of the activity. The qualifiers, such as “low carbon” vehicles or “low carbon” vessels for the purpose of Section 3.3 in the Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act (“manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport”), which are not defined in a clear way, should only be taken into account for the purposes of determining the compliance with the technical screening criteria and are therefore not relevant for the reporting on eligibility. For example, a car manufacturer would be able to report as eligible all their car manufacturing activities, including those of combustion engine cars.\nOn the other hand, in the case of the activity “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” (Section 3.6) the description of the activity points to the objective of the activity. The activity covers manufactured technologies that are “aimed at substantial life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings in other sectors of the economy”. For any activity or product to be eligible for climate change mitigation under this category, the activity or product needs to have the objective of enabling a substantial reduction of GHG emissions in another sector of the economy. This means that if a technology is the best in their sector, but does not aim at substantial emission reductions in another sector, it would not be eligible. For example, a very energy efficient manufacturing process of a screw which does not aim to lead to emission reduction in another sector, would not qualify.\nIn a similar way, activity 10.1 in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (‘Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils’) refers to ‘climate related perils’. These are set out in\nAppendix A\nto Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (‘Classification of climate-related hazards’). Insurance undertakings may only count a line of business as taxonomy eligible if it contains a policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils."

  {
    "question": "Should undertakings report a breakdown of Taxonomy eligibility per environmental objective?",
    "answer": "Activities contributing to both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation as defined in the Climate Delegated Act are within the scope of the first reporting year(s).\nArticle 10(2) and 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. They also do not explicitly require a distinction between environmental objectives for mitigation and adaptation in the first year(s) of eligibility reporting.\nHowever, advice is for undertakings to use on voluntary basis the templates included in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act that require a split of environmental objectives for alignment reporting.\nThis suggestion is justified by the fact that when reporting their Taxonomy-alignment key performance indicators (KPIs) in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings will be required to break down their economic activities based on their contributions across environmental objectives as specified in the tables of the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act. This would make it easier to compare Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and Taxonomy-alignment reporting. It would also make reporting more consistent across undertakings’ first year(s) of eligibility reporting to prepare for their taxonomy-alignment reporting, on a voluntary basis.\nFor activities covered, climate change mitigation and adaptation largely overlap in scope. However, for reporting the alignment KPIs, it should be noted that there are some important differences between the two Annexes to the Climate Delegated Act catering for specificities for each objective. These differences are set out in the bullet points below.\nCertain activities are included only for climate change mitigation (Annex I) and not for climate change adaptation (Annex II), notably:\n‘Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions’ (Section 8.2);\n‘Research, development and innovation for direct air capture of CO2’ (Section 9.2);and\n’Professional services related to energy performance of buildings’ (Section 9.3).\nCertain activities are included only for climate change adaptation (Annex II) and not for climate change mitigation (Annex I), notably:\n’Computer programming, consultancy and related activities’ (Section 8.2);\n’Programming and broadcasting activities’ (Section 8.3); and\n’Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change’ (Section 9.1).\nIn addition, activities across the following sectors are only included for climate change adaptation:\nInsurance;\neducation;\nhuman health;\nsocial work; and\narts, entertainment, and recreation.\nCertain activities are included in both Annexes to the Climate Delegated Act but their names and descriptions differ. Notably, this concerns certain infrastructure for transport activities (Sections 6.15, 6.16 and 6.17) and certain manufacturing activities (such as Sections 3.2. and 3.4.). The names and descriptions of these activities were tailored to the specificities of the respective objective.\nLastly, some inconsistencies in the titles and descriptions of activities in Annexes I and Annex II have been signalled. For example, the words ‘light’ and ‘renting’ are missing in respectively the title and the description of activity 6.5. ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles’ in Annex II. Any such inconsistencies should be signalled to the Commission for further correction.\nThe\nbriefing\n(14)\nPlatform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\nof the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting."

    "question": "How are turnover, CapEx and OpEx defined in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?",
    "answer": "The Disclosures Delegated Act sets out the definitions of Turnover, CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators (KPIs) in Sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 of\nAnnex I\nrespectively.\nNon-financial undertakings should disclose the part of their net turnover (as defined in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I  to the Disclosures Delegated Act) that corresponds to their  Taxonomy-eligible economic activities.\nAs regards eligible CapEx information, in accordance with Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, reporting focuses on the three categories of CapEx:\na) CapEx that is related to assets or processes corresponding to Taxonomy-eligible economic activities;\nb) CapEx that is part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activities or enable Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned.\nc) CapEx mentioned in category (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, relating to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act and other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted under Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe measures corresponding to category (c) must be implemented and operational within 18 months.\nFor CapEx category c), the assessment focuses on the output and individual measures. It does not focus on the target economic activity for which the expenditure is incurred. Entities must assess whether the expenditure qualifies as:\na purchase of an output of a Taxonomy-eligible activity; or\nan individual measure to improve energy efficiency included in the Taxonomy.\nIn other words such outputs and measures must be listed in the Climate Delegated Act. Expenditures on assets or processes which might be useful to enable the target activity to become low-carbon but which are not activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act do not fall under category (c).\nFor a non-eligible target activity, for example a restaurant purchasing and installing solar panels, such expenditures could fall under category (c). For renovation of buildings, category (c) only covers measures corresponding to activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act (e.g. certain energy-efficient windows).\nThe reporting of OpEx for the first year(s) of implementation of the Disclosures Delegated Act must follow the same approach.  Reporting on the three categories mentioned in Section 1.1.3.2 should focus on the eligibility of the economic activities to which this expenditure correspond. Therefore, the three categories (a), (b) and (c) mentioned in Sections 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.3.2 relating to the numerator of CapEx and OpEx, respectively, are relevant for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of implementation of the Disclosures Delegated Act.\nFor example, regarding category (b), any CapEx on eligible activities made in 2021 (and reported in 2022 disclosures) would count as eligible in the 2022 report. This is regardless of whether the investment under the CapEx plan will meet the technical screening criteria set out in the Climate Delegated Act at maturity.\nSimilarly, OpEx category (b) on eligible activities made in 2021 (and reported in 2022 disclosures) would count as eligible in the 2022 report. This is irrespective of whether the corresponding  economic activity meets the technical screening criteria. This is because entities do not need to report on the alignment of their economic activities in the first year of reporting.\nThe\nbriefing\n(15)\nPlatform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\nof the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting."

    "answer": "The Disclosures Delegated Act does not specify how to treat negative revenues under Taxonomy eligibility reporting.\nNegative revenue could be treated as a 0% value for Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. However, undertakings could, report the negative value in monetary amount.\nIf the entity makes negative revenue within one activity, the denominator could be the absolute value of the positive turnover from the remaining activities.

Annex I, Section 1.2.2.1, point (c), explicitly states that undertakings should explain how they avoided double counting in the allocation of the amounts of Taxonomy-aligned turnover, CapEx and OpEx in the numerator of the relevant KPIs. The intention behind this requirement is to ensure reliability and consistency in reporting the three KPIs.\nIt is suggested that under their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, undertakings adopt a similar approach to that under Annex I, Section 1.2.2.1. Undertakings must explain how they have avoided double counting of the relevant amounts of turnover and expenditure across their reporting of eligible economic activities."

This is to ensure comparability with the turnover reported in the entity's consolidated financial statements.

However, all related assets and liabilities must be derecognised from the statement of financial position upon deconsolidation.\nFor example, a subsidiary is sold on 30 June and up to that date it has generated Taxonomy‑eligible turnover. Therefore, on 31 December, the parent undertaking reporting under IFRS will no longer consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary due to the loss of control that occurred on 30 June. H, it will still account in its income statement for the Taxonomy-eligible turnover arising from the former subsidiary up until June 30.

For credit institutions, assets held for trading as defined in\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451\n(26)\nCommission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 of 17 December 2020 laying down implementing technical standards for the application of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions and repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, OJ L 97, 19.3.2021, p. 1.\n(FINREP))  also do not fall under the KPIs.\nIn line with the exclusions under Article 10(3) (b) and (c), financial undertakings should use a scope of covered assets for their eligibility reporting disclosures that is similar to the scope of covered assets for their alignment reporting. This would make it easier to compare Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and Taxonomy-alignment reporting.\nThis means that the financial undertaking should clearly indicate:\nthe assets that are excluded from the denominator of the Taxonomy-eligible assets ratio (e.g. exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers; the trading portfolio of credit institutions); and\nthe percentage of covered assets that are Taxonomy-eligible over total assets."

    "question": "Should cash and cash equivalent assets be considered in the context of Taxonomy eligibility reporting?",
    "answer": "Article 10(3) should be read in conjunction with Article 7 (1), (2) and (3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Cash and cash equivalent assets are not excluded from the exposures referred to in Article 7 (1), (2) and (3).\nUnder the Disclosures Delegated Act and its Annex I, these exposures are included in the denominator of the Taxonomy-aligned KPIs of financial institutions. However, it does not seem feasible to assess the eligibility of cash and cash equivalent assets as they are not actually funding an economic activity. It is also not clear which economic activity these assets will be allocated. These assets can only be reported as funding eligible activities once the funds have been allocated to a specific activity."

However, advice is for  undertakings to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\nIn this regard, Annex III to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the details of the numerator and denominator of asset managers’ for their Taxonomy-aligned KPIs.\nIn accordance with Annex III Section 1 (‘\nContent of KPI to be disclosed by asset managers’\n), eligibility reporting is not weighted by the stake in the undertaking’s equity, debt or enterprise value including cash. It is weighted by the value of the exposures in the total assets of the asset manager (see the definition of the numerator in Annex III, Section 1.1).\nFor example, where an asset manager is exposed to two assets:\nEUR 100m equity in 100% eligible company A;\nEUR 100m bond in 0% eligible company B.\n= EUR 200m total assets.\nThis means: 50% eligibility over total assets = (100*100% + 100*0%)/200.\nThe\nbriefing\n(27)\nPlatform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\nof the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting."

However, advice is for undertakings to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\nIn this regard, Annex V to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the details of how credit institutions must report their Taxonomy-alignment KPIs:\nIf the use of proceeds is unknown i) loans and advances – general purpose, (ii) debt securities - general purpose, and (iii) equity holdings, all of which are recorded in the banking book), Taxonomy aligned/eligibility exposures should be calculated twice.

However, advice is for undertakings  to voluntarily use the templates provided in the Annexes of the Disclosures Delegated Act to prepare their Taxonomy-eligibility reporting.\nIn this regard, Annex V to the Disclosures Delegated Act, sets out the details of how to assess and report loans and debt instruments for Taxonomy-alignment KPIs. Annex V explains that general purpose lending or debt carries the Taxonomy-eligibility turnover or CapEx value of the underlying entity (i.e. investee or counterparty).\nTo calculate Taxonomy-eligibility of general-purpose debt instruments, it is recommended to apply the eligibility value of the underlying entity (turnover and CapEx).\nIf all or a portion of the use of proceeds of a debt instrument is Taxonomy-eligible, reporting of this value would take precedence over the issuer-level value within the Taxonomy-alignment KPIs. Such proceeds may be directly allocated to Taxonomy-eligible activities or be part of a CapEx or OpEx plan to render an activity or asset Taxonomy-aligned.\nFor Taxonomy-eligibility reporting, it could be considered, for example, that if 50% of the proceeds of the debt instrument are allocated to Taxonomy-eligible projects or programmes, the Taxonomy-eligibility Turnover and CapEx values of the bond should be 50%.\nIn this sense, not all of a use of proceeds (green) debt instrument would be eligible under the Taxonomy in its entirety.

    "question": "Can green SME debt that is taxonomy-aligned be reported as eligible?",
    "answer": "Article 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act clarifies that financial undertakings shall disclose eligible activities having considered the provisions stated under Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act.\nIn accordance with Article 7(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, exposures to undertakings that are not obliged to publish non-financial information according to Article 19a or 29a Accounting Directive including SME investments/exposures are excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator of Taxonomy reporting of financial undertakings.\nHowever, Article 7(4) of the same Delegated Act states that ‘\nwithout prejudice to paragraph 1, environmentally sustainable bonds or debt securities with the purpose of financing specific identified activities that are issued by an investee undertaking shall be included in the numerator of key performance indicators up to the full value of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that the proceeds of those bonds and debt securities finance, on the basis of information provided by the investee undertaking\n.’\nTherefore, financial undertakings should include the proportion of Taxonomy-eligibility of the proceeds of those environmentally sustainable bonds and debt securities whose purpose is to finance specific identified activities, as part of the numerator of the eligibility disclosure.\nDebt securities in Article 7(4) include SME use of proceeds bonds, and do not include SME use of proceed loans, in line with the definitions provided in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 (FINREP).\n(11)\nAnnex V of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/451 and Definition of SME Commission Recommendation Article 1 2(a).\nAs a general remark, the scope of this exclusion from the numerator of the key performance indicator (KPI) is subject to a review by 2024 in accordance with Article 9 of the Disclosures Delegated Act.

    "question": "How does the Taxonomy Regulation Article 8 Delegated Act interact with the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) developed under the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR)?",
    "answer": "The Disclosures Delegated Act requires transparency on the extent to which the activities of undertakings, subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, are taxonomy-aligned. The information disclosed in compliance with the Disclosures Delegated Act could be used as part of other disclosures, such as those falling under the financial product-related transparency requirements of the\nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) (EU) 2019/2088\n. By way of example, where financial products include investments in shares of such undertakings, the financial market participants that offer those financial products should use the taxonomy key performance indicators (KPIs) of investee companies for their own disclosures.\nOn 22 October 2021, the European Supervisory Authorities jointly submitted to the Commission draft Regulatory Technical Standards developed under Article 25(2) to (4) of the Taxonomy Regulation. The draft Regulatory Technical Standards specify information required in Articles 5 and 6 of the Taxonomy Regulation on “how and to what extent” financial products referred to in Articles 8 and 9 SFDR invest, or are invested, in sustainable economic activities within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nThe application of the SFRD or Articles 5 and 6 of the Taxonomy Regulation is not conditional on the formal adoption and entry into force or application of the Regulatory Technical Standards.

    "question": "What is the rationale for the Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "The goal of the EU Taxonomy is to prevent greenwashing and to help investors identify economic activities in line with our environmental and climate objectives.\nShifting towards renewable energy is essential for achieving climate neutrality. But it is also necessary to have stable sources to accelerate the transition towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe\nTaxonomy Regulation\nlays out three types of activities: low-carbon (Article 10(1)), transitional (Article 10(2)) and enabling (Article 16).\nIn this Complementary Climate Delegated Act, the Commission includes certain nuclear and gas activities in the second category of activities, i.e. transitional, those covered by Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. These are activities that cannot yet be replaced by technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, but do contribute to climate change mitigation and with the potential to play a major role in the transition to a climate-neutral economy, in line with EU climate goals and commitments, and subject to strict conditions, without crowding out investment in renewables.\nFurthermore, this Delegated Act also provides for specific disclosure requirements associated with natural gas and nuclear energy activities included in the act, by amending the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. This amendment will introduce requirements for large listed non-financial and financial companies to disclose the proportion of their activities linked to natural gas and nuclear energy. This should help investors to distinguish between the different activities they are investing in."

  {
    "question": "How ambitious are the technical screening criteria, and do the included activities really lead to environmental benefits, e.g. as compared to energy production from coal?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act includes strict requirements for the activities to qualify. In the case of fossil gas-related activities, for example, the facility should switch fully to renewable or low-carbon gases by 31 December 2035. This can help accelerate the transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon gases.\nNuclear power is low-carbon. Expert advice sought by the Commission as part of its preparatory work (the reports of the Technical Expert Group until 2020, and the report of the Joint Research Committee in 2021) confirms this.\nFollowing scientific advice, the Commission has concluded that nuclear energy, subject to strict safety and environmental conditions (including on waste disposal) that ensure the respect of the do no significant harm principle, can play a role in the transition towards climate neutrality in line with the European Green Deal."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the rationale for defining nuclear activities as being in line with the EU's climate and environmental objectives?",
    "answer": "The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, advising the Commission on Taxonomy, acknowledged that nuclear represents a low-carbon energy source. This is in line with the positions of international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which consider CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants over their life-cycle comparable to those from renewable energy sources (as low or even lower).\nHowever, expert opinion has been less conclusive on the other environmental impacts of nuclear power and its compatibility with the “do no significant harm (DNSH)” criterion. For this reason, the Commission set up a specific process on nuclear energy, involving a technical assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people.\nFor nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place."
  },
  {
    "question": "What about considerations on nuclear waste?",
    "answer": "The\nTaxonomy Regulation\nrequires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment.\nNuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste.\nThe EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum.\nIn addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries."

    "question": "What is the rationale for defining certain gas-related activities as “substantially contributing to” the EU climate and environmental objectives?",
    "answer": "During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act.\nThe European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently,\nthe Fit for 55 Package\n). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply.\nThe EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the\nClimate Target Plan\nand the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition."

  {
    "question": "Unlike nuclear power, natural gas undoubtedly releases CO2 when it is converted into electricity or heat. How can this form of energy lead to environmental benefits?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels – a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated.\nThe technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035."

    "question": "What activities and accompanying criteria does the Complementary Climate Delegated Act introduce?",
    "answer": "Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act:\nintroduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy.\nThe Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy.\nintroduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors.\nThose requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency.\nMore specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities:\nNuclear-related activities\n:\nAdvanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (“Generation IV”) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);\nNew nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (“Generation III+”), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);\nModifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority)\nGas-related\nactivities\n:\nEach gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds:\nlifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, or\nuntil 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out."

    "question": "What are the amendments introduced to the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation?",
    "answer": "In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors.\nIn addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors."

    "question": "What are the main benefits for financial and non-financial companies associated with this disclosures delegated act?",
    "answer": "The Article 8 disclosures delegated act will increase transparency in the market, mitigate risks of greenwashing and subsequent reputational risks for financial institutions. This provision will also increase the space for green finance and encourage financial market participants to design financial products and portfolios on the basis of these disclosures.\nFinancial institutions need a homogenous and rigorous evaluation of the climate and environmental performance of the companies and assets that they finance. Under this disclosures delegated act, they will be able to use common ratios per company based on turnover, CapEX and OpEx to calculate the overall alignment of their portfolios and balance sheets through weighted aggregation.\nNon-financial companies will be able to communicate the degree of environmental performance of their economic activities and assets to financial institutions, stakeholders and peers. It will enable them translate long-term climate transition and environmental objectives into tangible business strategies.\nWith this disclosures delegated act, environmental and social benefits are expected due to an increase in capital flows towards environmentally sustainable economic activities, helping to deliver the EU’s climate and environmental objectives as targeted by the Taxonomy Regulation."

    "question": "How does this disclosures delegated act interact with the climate delegated act adopted on 4 June and the future environmental delegated act specifying the technical screening criteria for the remaining environmental objectives?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy climate delegated act formally adopted on 4 June 2021 provides the first technical screening criteria for companies and financial market participants on which economic activities can be considered to make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation objectives.\n(4)\nAvailable on the website of the Commission:\ntaxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800_en.pdf (europa.eu)\n.\nTo complete the climate delegated act, the Commission will subsequently issue a complementary delegated act setting out technical screening criteria for climate mitigation and adaptation objectives notably for some energy sectors and agriculture.\nThe taxonomy will also be extended over time to additional environment objectives and should integrate more sectors and activities that make a positive contribution to these objectives through another delegated act to be adopted later.\nArticle 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation will rely on the above mentioned climate and environmental delegated acts to mandate companies to assess and report the alignment of their financial and non-financial activities with the EU Taxonomy.\nThe Article 8 disclosures delegated act and subsequent reporting obligations of financial and non-financial companies is structured so that it automatically integrates upcoming evolutions of the taxonomy and possible amendments brought to the Taxonomy Regulation."

  {
    "question": "How does this delegated act interact with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and related proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?",
    "answer": "Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation stipulates that any financial and non-financial undertaking in the scope of the NFRD is required to report the extent to which its activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation (‘Taxonomy-aligned economic activities’).\nThis disclosures delegated act, therefore, complements the NFRD by providing a common reference point for taxonomy-related reporting requirements under the two regulations. This disclosures delegated act is also consistent with the specific rules about non-financial reporting provided by the NFRD.\nThe Commission, through the CSRD proposal published on 21 April 2021, proposes to extend the scope of NFRD requirements to include all large companies, whether they are listed or not and without the previous 500-employee threshold\n(5)\nProposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2013/34/EU, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (COM/2021/189 final).\n. It responds to demands from investors for sustainability information from such companies. In addition, the CSRD is proposing to extend the scope to include listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with the exception of listed micro-enterprises.\nThe scope of undertakings subject to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation will adjust automatically to the changes brought to the NFRD by the CSRD as and where relevant."

    "question": "How will this disclosures delegated act interact with the SFDR and the forthcomings Ecolabel and EU Green Bond Standard?",
    "answer": "Taxonomy-related reporting is set to serve as a basis for various future and ongoing initiatives in sustainable finance.\nThis disclosures delegated act is developed after the adoption of the SFDR\n(6)\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability‐related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1–16).\nand should therefore be consistent with the upcoming ‘Regulatory Technical Standards’ (RTS)\n(7)\nThe European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) are developing through the Joint Committee (JC) the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) with regard to the content, methodologies and presentation of sustainability-related disclosures under empowerments Articles 2a, 4(6) and (7), 8(3), 9(5), 10(2) and 11(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation “SFDR”).\ndeveloped under this regulation.\nUnder the SFDR, financial market participants are required to disclose the extent to which their financial products are environmentally sustainable and address adverse sustainability impacts. They shall equally report the extent to which their financial products are aligned with the climate and future environmental delegated acts. While the RTS will specify the taxonomy-alignment of financial products, this disclosures delegated act specifies the extent to which the assets of financial institutions are taxonomy-aligned at the entity level.\nThe disclosure obligations under this disclosures delegated act will also facilitate the development of Union-wide standards for environmentally sustainable financial products and the establishment of labels that recognise compliance with these standards. Notably, the Commission proposals for an EU Green Bond Standard (EU GBS) and an EU Ecolabel for financial products are expected to rely on the Taxonomy Regulation to demonstrate the alignment of those sustainable financial products with the sustainability goals.\nTaxonomy-related disclosures will therefore enable an entire ecosystem of other sustainable finance tools, including standards, labels and access to a coherent and relevant set of sustainability data, which are necessary to channel capital towards the investments needed to reach Union goals."

    "question": "What should non-financial companies report under this disclosures delegated act?",
    "answer": "Non-financial companies shall disclose the proportion of environmentally sustainable economic activities\nthat align with the EU Taxonomy criteria. The translation of environmental performance into financial variables (turnover, CapEx and OpEx KPIs) allows in turn investors and financial institutions to have clear and comparable data to help them with their investment and financing decisions. The main KPIs for non-financial companies include:\nThe\nturnover\nKPI represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are taxonomy-aligned. The Turnover KPI gives a static view of the companies contribution to environmental goals.\nThe\nCapEx\nKPI represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach taxonomy-alignment. CapEx provides a dynamic and forward-looking view of companies’ plans to transform their business activities.\nThe\nOpEx\nKPI represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with taxonomy-aligned activities or to the CapEx plan. The operating expenditure covers direct non-capitalised costs relating to research and development, renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective use of such assets.\nThe\nplan\nthat accompanies both the CapEx and OpEx KPIs shall be disclosed at the economic activity aggregated level and meet the following conditions:\nit shall allow extending the scope of taxonomy-aligned economic activities or it shall allow economic activities to become taxonomy-aligned within a period of maximum 10 years;\nit shall be approved by the management board of non-financial undertakings or another body which has been delegated this task.\nThis disclosures delegated act considers that a credible plan is a necessary condition to ensure that companies are embarking on a trajectory aimed to make their economic activities taxonomy-aligned. A credible plan should minimise companies´ reputational risks, support their environmental target and develop strategic and forward-looking business decisions.\nIn addition, non-financial companies should provide for a\nbreakdown of the KPIs\nbased on the economic activity pursued, including transitional and enabling activities, and the environmental objective reached.\nTo ensure greater transparency, specific accompanying information should be reported for the share of economic activities that are described in the Commission’s delegated acts, but that do not yet meet the relevant technical screening criteria (‘\ntaxonomy-eligible economic activities’)\nand the share of economic activities that are not covered by the Taxonomy-related delegated acts. The companies are not required to disclose the assessments about the technical screening criteria that Taxonomy-eligible economic activities fail to meet, but may do so voluntarily, in particular to attract investors to finance their plans to reach taxonomy-alignment in the future. The combination of this accompanying information with the three KPIs is important for a company to finance and show over time the transition of its taxonomy-eligible economic activities towards taxonomy-alignment.\nFinally, this disclosures delegated act requires non-financial companies to provide for\naccompanying qualitative information\nabout the calculation and the key elements for change of the three KPIs during the reporting period."

The investment KPI relates to the investment policy of insurers and reinsurance undertakings for the funds resulting from their underwriting activities. The underwriting KPI relates directly to their underwriting activities.\nThe KPI related to investments shall be calculated as the proportion of the investments of insurance or reinsurance undertakings that are associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities in relation to their investments (see Green Investment Ratio in the asset management section). As for asset managers, insurers shall rely on the underlying investee companies’ KPIs to compute their own investment KPI.\nThe KPI related to underwriting activities shall be calculated as the proportion of the ‘non-life gross premiums written’ corresponding to taxonomy-aligned insurance activities as defined in the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act in relation to total non-life gross premiums written."

    "question": "How does this disclosures delegated act treat exposures to companies that are not subject to the reporting under this delegated act (SMEs, non-EU companies) in the reporting of financial companies?",
    "answer": "Companies not subject to the NFRD, including SMEs (‘non-NFRD undertakings’) may decide to voluntarily disclose their taxonomy-alignment KPIs for the purpose of accessing environmentally sustainable finance, e.g. as part of eco-labelling schemes and environmentally sustainable products based on alignment with Taxonomy Regulation or as part of their overall business strategy based on environmental sustainability.\nHowever, to provide SMEs and/or non-EU companies with sufficient time to adjust to the new situation and to decide whether to report voluntarily under the Taxonomy Regulation and financial institutions to collect relevant information from those undertakings, this disclosures delegated act provides that financial undertakings should not include such information in the numerator of their own KPIs.

  {
    "question": "What is the EU Taxonomy?",
    "answer": "The EU Taxonomy is a green classification system that translates the EU’s climate and environmental objectives into criteria for specific economic activities for investment purposes.\nIt recognises as green, or ‘environmentally sustainable’, economic activities that make a\nsubstantial\ncontribution to at least one of the EU’s climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards.\nThe Taxonomy Delegated Acts will establish and maintain clear criteria for activities to define what it means to make a substantial contribution and what it means to do no significant harm.\nIt is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some companies and investors, requiring them to disclose their share of Taxonomy-aligned activities. This disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions.\nCompanies, if they wish, can reliably use the EU Taxonomy to plan their climate and environmental transition and raise finance for this transition. Financial companies, if they wish, can use the EU Taxonomy to design credible green financial products.\nNevertheless, the EU Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on environmental performance for companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in. However, it is expected that over time, the EU Taxonomy will be an enabler of change and encourage a transition towards sustainability.\nEconomic activities that are not recognised by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU’s climate and environmental objectives are not necessarily environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that can make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are yet part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Delegated acts will be living documents that will be added to over time and updated as necessary."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act?",
    "answer": "The EU Taxonomy provides a common understanding of economic activities that make a substantial contribution to the EU’s environmental goals, by providing consistent, objective criteria in delegated acts. The Taxonomy Regulation tasks the Commission with establishing these technical screening criteria through delegated acts.\nThe first delegated act under the EU Taxonomy on climate objectives sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant for achieving climate neutrality and delivering on climate change adaptation. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings. The process leading up to the adoption of this Delegated Act is explained in the answer to question 18.\nCriteria for other environmental goals will follow in a later delegated act, in line with the mandates in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Commission is currently preparing an IT tool to facilitate the use of the Taxonomy by allowing users to find the criteria more easily, for example by selecting the type of economic activity they are interested in."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do we need an EU Taxonomy?",
    "answer": "We need reliable tools to support companies in the transition to climate neutrality and a sustainable economy. The EU Taxonomy is one such tool, translating the climate and environmental objectives into clear criteria, to create a common language around green activities. It will create a frame of reference for investors and companies. It will support companies in their efforts to plan and finance their transition, help mitigate market fragmentation, protect against greenwashing and accelerate financing of those projects that are already sustainable and those in transition, to deliver on the objectives of the European Green Deal.\nIt is an important element of a much broader sustainable finance framework that will deliver a complete toolkit for financing the transition. The added value of the EU Taxonomy is that it can help scale up investment in green projects that are necessary to implement the European Green Deal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the EU Taxonomy fit within the broader sustainable finance framework?",
    "answer": "There are three disclosure tools that create one coherent framework:\nThe\nNon-Financial Reporting\nDirective (NFRD)\nis currently being revised (named after revision as Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive - CSRD), with the aim of delivering a comprehensive corporate reporting framework with qualitative and quantitative information to facilitate the assessment of companies’ sustainability impacts and risks.\nThe\nEU Taxonomy\nestablishes a common understanding of green economic activities that make a substantial contribution to EU environmental goals, by providing consistent, objective criteria. Together with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) these two instruments will ensure that companies falling under the scope of the CSRD disclose the environmental performance information of the company as well as information about a company’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\nThe\nSustainable Finance Disclosure\nRegulation (SFDR)\napplies from 10 March 2021 and complements corporate disclosures by creating a comprehensive reporting framework for financial products and financial entities. Compliance with sustainability-related disclosures is expected to have considerable behavioural effects on financial firms, and indirectly on the business models of companies that are being invested in. Different investment strategies may entail investments in economic activities with different levels of environmental performance. For this reason, the SFDR distinguishes disclosure requirements for:\nfinancial products that claim to have ‘sustainable investment’ as their objective (in the case of environmental objectives these are often referred to as ‘dark green’ financial products);\nfinancial products that claim to be promoting social or environmental characteristics (often referred to as ‘light green’ financial products).\nThe SFDR requirements are linked with those under the EU Taxonomy by including ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation in the definition of ‘sustainable investments’ in the SFDR. But neither the SFDR nor the Taxonomy Regulation provide criteria and define eligible investments or strategies for so-called ‘light green’ financial products. Therefore, the ESG ambition of ‘light green’ financial products may vary: for example, certain ‘light green’ financial products may partially pursue sustainable investments. Regulatory technical standards jointly developed by ESMA, EBA and EIOPA further specify disclosure requirements for ‘dark green’ and ‘light green’ financial products in terms of substance as well as presentation of information by means of standardised templates across the financial services sectors."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the EU Taxonomy define green economic activities?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Regulation\nlays out six EU environmental objectives:\nclimate change mitigation,\nclimate change adaptation,\nsustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\ntransition to a circular economy,\npollution prevention and control, and\nprotection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nIt also sets out four conditions that an economic activity has to meet to be recognised as Taxonomy- aligned:\nmaking a substantial contribution to at least one environmental objective;\ndoing no significant harm to any other environmental objective;\ncomplying with minimum social safeguards;\ncomplying with the technical screening criteria.\nThis technical screening criteria are developed in delegated acts. For each economic activity considered, the technical screening criteria specify environmental performance requirements that ensure the activity makes a\nsubstantial contribution to the environmental objective\nin question and\ndoes no significant harm\nto the other environmental objectives.\nThe technical screening criteria for ‘substantial contribution’ to an environmental objective ensure that the economic activity either has a substantial positive environmental impact or substantially reduces negative impacts on the environment, e.g. substantially reduced levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ ensure that the economic activity does not impede on the other environmental objectives from being reached, i.e. it has no significant negative impact on them.\nBoth sets of criteria together ensure coherence between the objectives in the EU Taxonomy and guarantee that progress towards one objective is not made at the expense of another.\nThe performance thresholds in these criteria are science-based and developed on the basis of a robust methodology and an inclusive process. They identify criteria for economic activities that can set sectors on a path consistent with the EU’s climate and environmental goals, based on currently available technologies.\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation, for example, means levels of performance that are aligned with climate neutrality and limiting the increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius globally. For climate change adaptation this means the implementation of solutions to substantially reduce the most significant identified climate risks to a particular activity such as wildfires, storms or droughts. The Taxonomy Regulation calls such activities ‘environmentally sustainable’: but this does not mean that activities that do not meet these four conditions are ‘unsustainable’.\nEconomic activities can make a substantial contribution through the specific means listed in Articles 10 to 15 of the Taxonomy Regulation. Based on these provisions, the draft Delegated Act contains a number of activities that can make a substantial contribution and defines criteria for those activities to qualify as green under the EU Taxonomy. The methodology used by the Commission is based on the work by the  Technical Expert Group (TEG). It considers that activities can make a substantial contribution when:\nthey have a low impact on the environment and have the potential to replace high impact activities (e.g. renewable energy);\nthey reduce impact from other activities (e.g. wastewater treatment); or\nthey make a positive environmental contribution (e.g. restoration of wetlands).\nThese are not types of activities explicitly listed in the Taxonomy Regulation. Instead, they are ways to understand and frame the concept of ‘substantial contribution’, based on Articles 10 to 15 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn addition, the Taxonomy Regulation explicitly recognises two specific types of activities that also make a substantial contribution. First, for the climate change mitigation objective, it recognises ‘transitional activities’. These are activities for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and that have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry. For example, this might include best-in-class cement manufacturing. Nevertheless, there are two conditions: (i) they should not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and (ii) they should not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the economic lifetime of those assets.\nThe second specific type of activity recognised as making a substantial contribution is referred to as ‘enabling activities’. These are activities that directly enable others to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective. For example, this could include manufacturing of renewable energy technologies, installation of energy efficiency equipment in buildings, research into materials for stronger flood defences, or use of cover crops that reduce the risk of flooding for an area."

  {
    "question": "What is the level of ambition of the EU Taxonomy ‘substantial contribution’ criteria? Why is it something higher than EU sectoral legislation?",
    "answer": "The EU Taxonomy recognises as ‘green’ activities those that – beside doing no significant harm and meeting minimum social safeguards – make a\nsubstantial\n, rather than a marginal, contribution to reaching the EU’s environmental objectives. It sets the criteria based on a level of ambition that strengthens the EU’s credibility and signals the activities that can substantially contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal. Given the huge investment needs and the necessary broad transformation of the EU economy, less than substantial improvements on the current levels of environmental performance - while still important - will in themselves not be sufficient to reach our green objectives.\nAlignment with EU sectoral policies is an important consideration. But there are good reasons why the Taxonomy criteria might both integrate and go beyond sectoral policies, the prevailing aim being alignment of the Taxonomy criteria with the ambition of the European Green Deal objectives. Also, there is a particular difference between requirements for a ‘substantial contribution’ and requirements for ‘doing no significant harm’.\nEstimates and early testing of the climate taxonomy criteria show a low overall Taxonomy alignment today in companies’ activities and investment portfolios (between 1% and 5%, with many companies and investment portfolios standing at zero). While this figure is expected to rise significantly with the implementation of the Green Deal, it highlights the extent of the transition still required towards carbon neutrality by 2050."

  {
    "question": "What is the coverage of the EU Taxonomy and why are some sectors or activities not covered?",
    "answer": "The European Parliament and the Council have prioritised economic activities that can make the most relevant contribution to the two environmental objectives under consideration. This first Delegated Act focuses on the climate objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation) and therefore includes activities that are most relevant for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and for improving climate resilience. This includes sectors with the highest contribution to CO2 emissions (energy, manufacturing, transport, buildings), as well as activities enabling their transformation, because the transformation of activities in these sectors is necessary to reach the EU’s climate objectives.\nThrough the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, the EU Taxonomy criteria cover the economic activities of roughly 40% of listed companies,\n(0)\nShare of EU domiciled companies with more than 500 employees active in economic sectors covered by the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act (Source: Bloomberg).\nin sectors which are responsible for almost 80% of direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.\n(1)\nSource: Eurostat.\nThrough this coverage, the EU Taxonomy can significantly increase the potential that green financing offers to support transition, in particular for carbon-intensive sectors where change is urgently needed.\nIt was not possible however to develop criteria for all sectors where activities could conceivably make a substantial contribution. The EU Taxonomy will be developed gradually over time, and further delegated acts, or revisions of existing ones, will likely include other economic activities from different sectors and sub-sectors of the economy, as these become relevant and feasible to be integrated into the EU Taxonomy. For example, the review of the criteria on forest management and bioenergy are foreseen in the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act itself.\nStakeholders will have an opportunity to notify the Platform on Sustainable Finance about activities they believe should be covered in the EU Taxonomy. The assessment of further economic activities will also be based on scientific evidence and broad stakeholder input. Gradually, additional sectors will be considered and additional activities will be included. For more information on the EU Taxonomy, including information on the gradual inclusion of economic sectors and activities, please see the\nFAQ\npreviously prepared by the Commission and Technical Expert Group on EU Taxonomy & EU Green Bond Standard.\nFurthermore, the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act reflects a delicate compromise on whether or not to include nuclear energy and natural gas among the activities covered by the Act. For this reason, in line with the legal framework and our past commitments, the Commission will adopt a complementary delegated act of the EU Taxonomy Regulation covering activities not yet covered in the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act such as agriculture, certain energy sectors and certain manufacturing activities. An additional delegated act will cover the other four environmental objectives as set out in the Taxonomy Regulation.\nA specific review process is underway on the role of nuclear energy as part of the Taxonomy Regulation, based on the report delivered by the Joint Research Centre,\n(2)\nJRC report: Technical assessment of nuclear energy with respect to the ‘do no significant harm’ criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (‘Taxonomy Regulation’) | European Commission (europa.eu)\nwhich is now being assessed by two expert committees,\n(3)\nThe\nScientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks\n, as well as the\nScientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks\non environmental impacts.\nwhich will finalise their review in June 2021. The Commission will adopt this complementary Delegated Act as soon as possible after the end of this specific review process. This complementary delegated act will also cover natural gas and related technologies as transitional activity in as far as they fall within the limits of Article 10(2) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\nFinally, a separate delegated act will focus on activities making a substantial contribution the other four environmental objectives as set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). The Platform on Sustainable Finance is working on recommendations for this act.\nIn addition, Article 26 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires the Commission to assess by the end of 2021 whether and how the scope of the Taxonomy Regulation could be extended to cover other levels of environmental performance than substantial contribution, as well as other objectives, such as social objectives."

    "question": "How will companies use the EU Taxonomy?",
    "answer": "There are some mandatory disclosure rules defined in the Taxonomy Regulation. Alongside these, companies can also use the EU Taxonomy voluntarily.\nMandatory use: disclosure\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation sets mandatory requirements on disclosure, with the aim of providing transparency on environmental performance.\nLarge financial and non-financial companies that fall under the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive will have to disclose to what extent the activities that they carry out meet the criteria set out in the EU Taxonomy. Likewise, financial market participants (such as asset managers) will have to disclose to what extent the activities that their financial products fund meet the EU Taxonomy criteria. Companies will be able to disclose the extent to which they invest, for example through capital expenditures, in either expanding or strengthening their activities which are already Taxonomy-aligned, or to upgrade other activities to make them Taxonomy-aligned. Disclosure on green revenue and green expenditure will provide the market with information on (1) companies whose activities comply with the EU Taxonomy criteria (through disclosure of share revenue from Taxonomy-aligned activities) and (2) companies that are taking steps to get there (through disclosure of green expenditure).\nFor more information on reporting obligations, please see the\nFAQ\npreviously prepared by the Commission and Technical Expert Group on the EU Taxonomy & EU Green Bond Standard. The details of these reporting requirements will be further specified in an upcoming delegated act under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation and in Regulatory Technical Standards to be adopted under Articles 8, 9 and 11 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\nVoluntary use: guide for investments\nThere are many possible voluntary uses of the EU Taxonomy by market participants, which are not defined in policy instruments. For example, companies can use the criteria of the EU Taxonomy as an input to their environmental and sustainability transition strategies and plans. Companies and project promoters can choose to meet the criteria of the EU Taxonomy with the aim of attracting investors interested in green opportunities. Investors can choose to use the EU Taxonomy criteria in their due diligence for screening and identifying sustainable investment opportunities aiming to achieve a positive environmental impact."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the EU Taxonomy be used elsewhere too?",
    "answer": "Green standards and labels\nThe Taxonomy Regulation requires Member States and the EU to use the EU Taxonomy as the basis of any EU or national (public) labels for green corporate bonds or financial products that fall under the scope of the SFDR. The EU Taxonomy therefore provides a good basis for the development of further sustainable finance tools, including the EU\nEcolabel for R\netail Financial Products and future EU standards for\ngreen bonds\n(all under development) as well as green mortgages.\nOngoing EU policy initiatives will link standards and labels to Taxonomy aligned economic activities:\nIn the current draft EU Ecolabel criteria for financial products, there is a requirement for a certain share of underlying activities invested in to be Taxonomy aligned. Thus, the EU Ecolabel will be awarded to financial products only if the companies they invest in carry out Taxonomy-aligned activities. It will be useful to have an ecolabel for financial products especially for retail investors who have corresponding sustainability preferences.\nThe EU Green Bond Standard (GBS) will define requirements for entities wishing to issue green bonds and claim compliance with this standard. These standards will include a requirement for companies to ensure that the proceeds raised through a bond issuance are used to finance Taxonomy-aligned activities.\nThe EU Climate Benchmarks Regulation lays down minimum standards for the creation of two types of climate benchmarks - EU climate transition and EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. These are to be made consistent with the EU Taxonomy by the end of 2022. The Commission will reflect on how to implement this obligation in practical terms and what obligations will be put on benchmark administrators for the selected companies or entities to form part of such benchmarks. It could be that benchmark administrators have to select companies that have a certain percentage of their activities classified as green as per the Taxonomy or that companies are excluded because they do not meet certain thresholds. The two EU climate benchmarks are largely used by market participants for the allocation of assets and should contribute to showcasing companies that have an impact on tackling climate change.\nEU instruments making reference to the EU Taxonomy\nIn addition to the mandatory uses set out in the Taxonomy Regulation discussed above, there are other EU (or national) policies that may refer to the Taxonomy Regulation. Such uses are not defined or mandated in the Taxonomy Regulation itself, but in other policy instruments, and do not necessitate the use of the Taxonomy criteria defined in the associated delegated acts. One area where the EU Taxonomy framework might be used, if deemed appropriate, is the design of financial support schemes or financial products. National Promotional Banks or Institutions may make reference to the EU Taxonomy framework to provide financial support to green investments at national level, or when proposing financing for green projects under the\nInvestEU\nProgramme.\nAnother important example is the use of the ‘do no significant harm’ principle of the Taxonomy Regulation in the\nRecovery and Resilience Facility\n(RRF). Here, the ‘do no significant harm principle’ is applied within the meaning of Article 17 of the Taxonomy Regulation but without requiring the use of the delegated acts and related technical screening criteria. Instead, the Commission published on 12 February 2021 a technical guidance document, providing more details on how to apply the ‘do no significant harm’ principle for the purposes of the RRF.\nSimilarly, based on the political agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on new rules for EU regional, cohesion and social funds for the period of 2021-2027, budget expenditure as part of those funds will also need to respect the ‘do no significant harm’ principle within the meaning of Article 17 of the Taxonomy Regulation. For the 2021/2022 work programme, the ‘do no significant harm’ principle was introduced when setting the call topics under the new EU Research Framework Programme,\nHorizon Europe."

  {
    "question": "How can companies benefit from having Taxonomy-aligned activities?",
    "answer": "Companies that fall under the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will be disclosing to the financial markets whether or not they have Taxonomy-aligned activities. Investors will have access to this information and can make investment decisions accordingly. Companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities will benefit from institutional investors, retail investors and banks interested in green investments, as they will be looking to finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\nInvestors that want to make a positive environmental impact will be interested in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities because they will know the given activity lives up to the established gold standard; i.e., has a high level of environmental performance and makes a substantial contribution.\nInstitutional investors can design their financial products in such a way as to fund some Taxonomy-aligned activities. Those under the scope of the SFDR will have to comply with mandatory disclosures whereby they also need to show to what extent, if any, there are underlying Taxonomy-aligned investments in the financial products they offer.\nLarge banks might also have an incentive to finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, for example through lending. This means that a company applying for a bank loan may be able to get a better interest rate if the purpose of the loan is to reach Taxonomy alignment of a given activity, or to fund Taxonomy-aligned activities.\nRetail investors are increasingly interested in green financial products. Given the upcoming amendments to the requirements for portfolio management and investment advice, those providing investment services need to consider the client’s sustainability preferences as well as their risk profile. This opens a channel for retail investors to state whether they prefer to invest in financial products that have a positive environmental impact or to avoid investing in those that do not, so that they can be offered financial products that match their preferences. Taking into account retail investors’ sustainability preferences when they are given financial advice creates better opportunities for companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities to reach retail investors.\nWhile it is not mandatory for companies to ensure their economic activities meet the criteria of the Taxonomy, it provides a motivation for companies to strive to reach a level of environmental performance that financial markets recognise as green. The Taxonomy Regulation, along with the SFDR, CSRD, and ongoing policy initiatives such as the EU Ecolabel for retail financial products and the EU Green Bond Standard, will ensure that Taxonomy-aligned activities are visible and recognised in investment decisions. Companies that wish to make a substantial contribution to reaching the climate and environmental objectives can voluntarily decide to use these criteria when planning their transition to sustainability."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the EU Taxonomy help companies transition towards sustainability?",
    "answer": "The EU Taxonomy criteria provide a reference point for companies in their decision-making regarding their green transition. Companies can use the EU Taxonomy to improve their overall environmental performance (either by upgrading current activities or starting new activities) and to attract investors.\nThe EU Taxonomy criteria are defined at the level of economic activities. Therefore, assessing the degree of alignment of a company with the EU Taxonomy requires checking the performance of its activities against the criteria.\nIn practice, the reporting procedures and resource planning will likely be organised at the level of the legal entity – or entities - of a given company. Legal entities would assess and report the percentage of their activities that are Taxonomy-aligned, expressed as the share of their Taxonomy-aligned turnover or expenditures (capital and operational). This information would then be aggregated across legal entities for the company as a whole.\nBy focusing on the activity level, the Taxonomy supports companies in their transition. It provides incentives to gradually increase their share of green economic activities to attract more investors or possibly new and different types of investors.\nKnowing the current environmental performance at the level of an activity will encourage companies to make transition plans and implement measures that get their activities to meet the EU Taxonomy criteria. By also covering capital expenditure linked to the transition plans, the EU Taxonomy can help attract investors searching for Taxonomy-aligned investments to finance the transition, helping both companies and investors to accelerate the transition to sustainability."
  },
  {
    "question": "My company is an SME. Can my company also benefit from the EU Taxonomy?",
    "answer": "Businesses of any size, including small companies, can use the EU Taxonomy to explain to investors or stakeholders in general whether they carry out or plan to carry out Taxonomy-aligned green activities. Disclosures are only mandatory for large companies within the scope of the CSRD, but many small companies and businesses could find it useful to disclose the Taxonomy alignment of their activities on a voluntary basis.\nSMEs whose business models are focused on one green activity covered by the EU Taxonomy will have only one set of criteria applicable to their business model. For example, a small manufacturer of energy-efficient windows could check relatively easily what share of its turnover, capital expenditure or operating expenditure is related to the sale of windows that comply with the Taxonomy criteria."
  },
  {
    "question": "My company’s activity is not covered in the EU Taxonomy. What does that mean for my company?",
    "answer": "As the answer to question 7 explains, not all economic activities are covered by the Taxonomy Regulation and its delegated acts. But this does not mean that the EU Taxonomy will be irrelevant to companies active in those sectors that are not covered. The\nTEG in its report\nsuggested that companies active in a sector that is not covered by the EU Taxonomy could use it for some of their expenditures into output of other activities that are Taxonomy-aligned (for example a hospital purchasing and installing solar panels, an energy efficient heating system or energy efficient windows from manufacturers that comply with Taxonomy criteria for these activities). The\nTransition Finance report\nof the Platform on Sustainable Finance also covers this question."
  },
  {
    "question": "My company’s activity is not Taxonomy-aligned. Can this activity’s environmental performance still be recognised somehow?",
    "answer": "While the EU Taxonomy only reveals whether companies have Taxonomy-aligned activities or not, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will require more detailed reporting on a broad range of sustainability issues, including environmental performance indicators. Based on that information, financial market participants can recognise different degrees of environmental performance that have not been categorised by law as Taxonomy-aligned.\nNevertheless, it is important to recall that (i) what does not qualify as a green economic activity under the EU Taxonomy is not necessarily unsustainable given the need to make a ‘substantial contribution’, and (ii) the EU Taxonomy does not constitute a mandatory list for investors to invest in. Thus, financial market participants can choose to invest in companies that carry out activities that have different degrees of environmental performance, including activities that do not comply with the EU Taxonomy criteria. In terms of further policy work, Article 26 of the Taxonomy Regulation calls for a Commission report by the end of 2021 on whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be extended to cover economic activities with no significant impact on the environment as well as economic activities that do significant harm to the environment. The Platform on Sustainable Finance will provide advice to the Commission to feed into that report, and the Platform’s\nreport on Transition\nFinance\nalso covers this issue."
  },
  {
    "question": "My company is taking steps to reduce the harmful impact on the environment of its activities. Will this improvement be recognised?",
    "answer": "Significant improvements in environmental performance are important and financial markets should be able to recognise them. Under the EU Taxonomy such improvements can only be qualified as Taxonomy-aligned if they lead to the substantial contribution threshold for at least one environmental objective being reached (without doing significant harm to any other objectives and if they comply with the minimum social safeguards). The Taxonomy Regulation identifies environmental performances that go further than simply refraining from doing significant harm.\nArticle 26 of the Taxonomy Regulation calls for a Commission report by the end of 2021 which will analyse whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be extended to cover economic activities with no significant impact, as well as economic activities that do significant harm to the environment.\nThe Platform on Sustainable Finance will provide advice to the Commission to feed into that report, and the Platform’s\nreport on Transition\nFinance\nalso covers this issue. In its report the Commission could look into, among other issues, the question of whether and how to recognise improvements in the environmental performance of activities that are causing significant harm to the environment, even if that improvement does not meet the criteria established for substantial contributions in the EU Taxonomy, but the improvement leads to performance levels better than significant harm."

    "question": "What was the process leading up to the adoption of the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and as of when will it apply?",
    "answer": "The\ndraft of the first Delegated Act\nwas published for public feedback on 20 November 2020, with the feedback period ending on 18 December. Based on the feedback received from stakeholders, the Commission issued a\nrequest for advice\nto the Platform on Sustainable Finance in January 2021, to explore and give advice on the existing and potential future use of the EU Taxonomy to facilitate the transition towards a sustainable economy. The Platform on Sustainable Finance delivered its\nreport on Transition Finance\non 19 March.\nThe Commission considered the stakeholder feedback as well as the report on Transition Finance and made changes to the draft Delegated Act to improve it where such improvement was possible. Stakeholder concerns that are best addressed outside the scope of the Delegated Act will be taken into account in the upcoming Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy and future policy work.\nThe Commission adopted the first Delegated Act on 21 April 2021, on which the European Parliament and the Council will have a scrutiny period of 4 months that can be extended by an additional 2 months. The European Parliament and the Council cannot amend the proposed technical screening criteria: the European Parliament and the Council only have a right to accept or reject the act in its entirety.\nFinancial entities and companies are already using or considering using the EU Taxonomy framework and will be able to report voluntarily as the first Delegated Act is adopted. For companies under the scope of the NFRD (after its revision, CSRD) mandatory reporting under the Taxonomy Regulation will apply from January 2022 for the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, and from January 2023 for the other four objectives.\nThis timeline was agreed by the European Parliament and the Council in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Commission will explore, including with input from the Platform on Sustainable Finance, appropriate guidance and options for how companies and financial market participants can meaningfully report in the first year of their reporting obligations, taking into account certain data gaps."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of the Platform on Sustainable Finance in developing the technical screening criteria?",
    "answer": "The Platform on Sustainable Finance is a permanent expert group of the European Commission that has been established under Article 20 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The Platform consists of world-leading sustainability and industry experts representing a wide range of stakeholders, including financial market participants, industry, civil society and academia. According to the Taxonomy Regulation, the Commission has to consult the Platform on Sustainable Finance, before adopting the delegated act on technical screening criteria. The Platform plays a key role in developing the technical screening criteria, as it provides indispensable technical and scientific input to the Commission and allows for a reasoned discussion among experts, reflecting the various stakeholders’ views. The Platform is advising the Commission on the technical screening criteria, as well as on the possible need to update those criteria. The Platform is also advising the Commission on the usability of the technical screening criteria and analysing the impact of the technical screening criteria in terms of potential costs and benefits of their application. As noted above the Platform will also assist the Commission in analyzing requests from stakeholders to develop or revise technical screening criteria for a given economic activity.\nIn addition to providing advice to the Commission on the development of the technical screening criteria, the Platform is also to advise the Commission on: (i) the further development of the EU Taxonomy framework, (ii) the monitoring of capital flows towards sustainable finance, and (iii) sustainable finance policy development. The Platform has already started its work on these tasks. More information about its work and structure is available on the website of the\nPlatform on Sustainable Finance."

    "question": "What role do the minimum safeguards play in the EU Taxonomy Regulation?",
    "answer": "The Taxonomy Regulation provides that an economic activity can only qualify as environmentally sustainable if, in addition to meeting the other requirements of Article 3\n(3)\nThe four criteria laid down in the Article 3 of the Taxonomy Regulation specify that an economic activity shall: (a) contributes substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives set out in Article 9 in accordance with Articles 10 to 16; (b) does not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives set out Article 9 in accordance with Article 17; (c) is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards laid down in Article 18; (d) complies with technical screening criteria that have been established by the Commission in accordance with Article 10 (3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2).\n, it is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards laid down in Article 18’. This is in line with the principles enshrined in the\nEuropean Pillar of Social Rights\nin support of a sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as with the relevant international minimum human and labour rights standards.\nThe minimum safeguards are therefore an integral part of the Taxonomy and are one of the four criteria laid down in Article 3 which must be met for economic activities to be considered environmentally sustainable. The inclusion of minimum safeguards in the Taxonomy framework aims to ensure that entities carrying out economic activities considered as Taxonomy-aligned meet certain minimum social and governance standards.\nIn other words, the purpose of the minimum safeguards under the Taxonomy Regulation is to prevent activities and investments from being regarded as ‘sustainable’ if they involve breaches of key social principles and human and labour rights or do not align with minimum standards for responsible business conduct."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the minimum safeguards defined under the Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy?",
    "answer": "Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation lays down specific requirements for minimum safeguards referring both to international standards of responsible business conduct under Article 18(1) and to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ of the SFDR\n(4)\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability‐related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1).\nunder Article 18(2).\nUnder\nArticle 18(1),\nminimum safeguards are to be understood as due diligence and remedy procedures implemented by a company that is carrying out an economic activity in order to ensure alignment with the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n(OECD MNEs)\nand the\nUN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n(UNGP)\n. The latter includes the principles and rights set out in eight of the ten fundamental conventions identified in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration of the on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\n(5)\nThe core conventions of the International Labour Organisaiton are:\nFreedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,\n1948 (No.87);\nRight to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention\n, 1949 (No. 98);\nForced Labour Convention\n, 1930 (No. 29) (and its 2014 protocol);\nAbolition of Forced Labour Convention\n, 1957 (No. 105);\nMinimum Age Convention\n, 1973 (No. 138);\nWorst Forms of Child Labour Convention\n, 1999 (No. 182);\nEqual Remuneration Convention\n, 1951 (No. 100);\nDiscrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention\n, 1958 (No. 111),\nand the International Bill of Human Rights\n(6)\nThis includes:\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\n(1948);\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n(1966); and\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\n(1966).\n.\nThe\nOECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\nbring together all thematic areas of responsible business conduct and responsible supply chain management. It also recommends that enterprises apply good corporate governance practices, including due diligence\n(7)\nSee also specific OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct (2018) and OECD sectoral guidance, available at:\nhttps://mneguidelines.oecd.org/mneguidelines/\n, which provides practical support to enterprises on the implementation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\nas set out in the\nOECD Principles of Corporate Governance\n.\nThe\nUN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n(i)specify a standard of conduct for businesses to prevent human-rights violations; and (ii) address any potential risks resulting from the economic activities that businesses conduct. The responsibility of business entities to respect human rights refers to internationally recognised rights understood, as a minimum, as those expressed in eight of the ten fundamental ILO conventions and in the International Bill of Human Rights\nArticle 18(2)\nintroduces a direct link with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ (DNSH) referred to in Article 2(17)  of the SFDR. This ensures that minimum social standards are defined at European level, and that there is consistency in European legislation.\nThe details of the SFDR’s principle of ‘do no significant harm’ are specified in\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\nadopted by the European Commission in April 2022. According to this regulation, in addition to disclosing whether the sustainable investment is aligned with the OECD MNEs and UN GP, implementing the SFDR principle of do no significant harm requires the consideration of a list of principal adverse indicators. The European Commission considers that, in the context of the Article 18(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the link between the minimum safeguards and the principle of DNSH of the SFDR is to be understood, as a minimum, through the SFDR principal adverse impact indicators for social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters listed in the table 1 of Annex I of the SDFDR Delegated Regulation.\n(8)\nThe methodology for the calculation of these indicators can be found in Annex I of the\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\n. The term ‘investee companies’ in table 1 of Annex I of the\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\ncorresponds to references to ‘undertakings’ in the Taxonomy Regulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key expectations for undertakings under Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation?",
    "answer": "Undertakings disclosing their alignment with the Taxonomy will need to assess their compliance with the Taxonomy’s minimum safeguards requirements under both Article 18(1) and Article 18(2).\nUnder\nArticle 18(1)\n, undertakings whose economic activities are to be considered as Taxonomy-aligned must have implemented due diligence and remedy procedures to ensure the alignment with the standards for responsible business conduct mentioned in the\nOECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\nand the\nUN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n(see question 2). Both these texts extensively outline how the principles and conduct of due diligence can be implemented.\nThe central requirement under Article 18(1) is that an undertaking must implement appropriate procedures, including procedures to continuously identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate the relevant actual and potential adverse impacts connected with their own operations, value chains and business relationships in order to ensure their activities are carried out in line with these standards.\nSometimes, despite implementing all appropriate procedures, an undertaking cannot address certain risks or eliminate certain negative impacts. This does not necessarily mean that the undertaking does not comply with the minimum safeguards, provided that the undertaking has clearly disclosed these potential impacts and explained what it did to identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate them and why it could not eliminate certain impacts. In fact, it is recognised that there can be instances where, despite reasonable due diligence measures, undertakings may still not be able to prevent, cease or mitigate adverse impacts when it comes to the adverse impacts in the undertaking’s value chain.\nAs part of those due diligence and remedy procedures, companies are required under\nArticle 18(2)\nto consider the SFDR principal adverse impact indicators related to social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters referred to under question 2\n(9)\nThe methodology for the calculation of these indicators can be found in Tables 1 and 3 of Annex I of the\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\n.\n.\nThe only issue covered by Article 18(2) as of today which is not explicitly covered by Article 18(1) is the principal adverse impact relating to the exposure to controversial weapons as defined under the SFDR Delegated Regulation\n(10)\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288\n(anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons and biological weapons). Therefore, by virtue of Article 18(2), undertakings are to ensure that their due diligence and remedy procedures allow for the identification, prevention, mitigation or remediation of any actual or potential exposure to the manufacture or selling of controversial weapons.\nBeyond the provisions of Article 18(2) described above, the Taxonomy Regulation does not contain further considerations relating to weapons or defence-related equipment and technologies in the assessment of minimum safeguards. As stated in the\nDraft Commission notice on interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act\n(11)\nQuestion 11 ‘\nHow does the sustainable finance framework apply to access to private funding for the defence industry\n?’, p.16.\n, the Commission acknowledges the need to ensure access to finance and investment including from the private sector for all strategic sectors, including the defence industry. The defence industry is recognised as a crucial contributor to the resilience and security of the Union, and therefore to peace and social sustainability\n(12)\nSee Commission’s proposal for\nProposal for an Act in Support of Ammunition Production\n(ASAP), COM(2023) 237 final.\n.\nThe list of SFDR indicators related to social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery might change with potential future revisions of the SFDR delegated act. That is why any issue that may be addressed in the future by the adverse indicators of the SFDR will also need to be considered by undertakings according to Article 18(2).\nReporting in line with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n(13)\nDirective (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (OJ L 322, 16.12.2022, p. 15).\n(CSRD) will help companies to assess their compliance with Article 18 requirements and will help investors to get the necessary information from investee companies\n(14)\nThe CSRD requires that the sustainability reporting standards that undertakings are required to use to meet their disclosure obligations contain the information that financial market participants need in order to comply with their disclosure obligations under the SFDR. In practice this means that undertakings will be required to report the mirroring information for the principal adverse impact indicators required under the delegated regulation of the SFDR.\nArticle 29b(5)(b) CSRD\n. Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation does not require additional disclosures, there is therefore no duplication with the CSRD reporting requirements.\nFor further informal advice on best practices, users are invited to consult the\nFinal Report on Minimum Safeguards of the Platform on Sustainable Finance\npublished in October 2022."

    "question": "Do Taxonomy-aligned investments qualify as ‘sustainable investment’ under the SFDR?",
    "answer": "Recital 19 of the Taxonomy Regulation clarifies that ‘sustainable investments’ under the SFDR include investments into ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation.\nIn setting out what is required for an activity to be considered as ‘environmentally sustainable’, Article 18(2) makes a link between the Taxonomy Regulation and the SFDR via one of the required steps of the Taxonomy Regulation: the compliance with minimum safeguards. According to the guidance given under question 1 and 2 above, the social elements of the ‘do no significant harm’ principle are considered to be adhered to at entity level for an undertaking that discloses activities as ‘environmentally sustainable’ under the EU Taxonomy.\nFurthermore, according to the guidance provided in questions 1 and 2 above, the SFDR do no significant harm principle and the requirement to ensure that an investee company follows good governance practices are deemed to be fulfilled for investments in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities as these comply with the Taxonomy’s minimum safeguards. The four aspects of good governance referred to in point 17 of Article 2 of the SFDR (namely sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff and tax compliance\n(15)\nThe\nEU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes\nwas updated in February 2023. It provides useful guidance to identify countries which have failed to fulfil their commitments to comply with tax good governance criteria within a specific timeframe, and countries which have refused to do so.\n) can be considered to be satisfied by the provisions referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.\nTherefore,\nsuch investments in Taxonomy-aligned ‘environmentally sustainable’ economic activities can be automatically qualified as ‘sustainable investments’ in the context of the product level disclosure requirements under the SFDR. This means that investments in specific economic activities can be considered to be sustainable investments.\nHowever, if a financial market participant (FMP) invests in an undertaking with some degree of taxonomy-alignment through a funding instrument that does not specify the use of proceeds, such as a general equity or debt, the FMP would still need to check additional elements under the SFDR in order to consider the whole investment in that undertaking as sustainable investment. This means that the FMP would still need to: (i) check whether the rest of the economic activities of the undertaking comply with the environmental elements of the SFDR DNSH principle; and (ii) assess whether she/he considers the contribution to the environmental objective sufficient."
